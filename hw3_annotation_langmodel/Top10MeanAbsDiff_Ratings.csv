t3_n9938v,5.0,1.0,group_08,4.0,"Eli5 What is glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis?","Glycogenesis: how your body creates glycogen. Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is simply glucose molecules strung together. Your muscles keep a small supply on hand to do their job, and your liver is where your body keeps most of it. Gluconeogenesis: how your body makes glucose from smaller molecules when the supply of carbohydrates runs low. Some cells must have this because they can't run on ketones--like nerve cells. This normally doesn't happen since it's easier to convert other carbohydrates into glucose instead. Ketogenesis: how your body makes ketone bodies. This is how you get energy out of fats and amino acids. They're converted to ketone bodies that most of your cells can feed into the mitochondria to produce ATP. The ones that can't need the gluconeogenesis above."
t3_ngi7ra,5.0,1.0,group_19,4.0,What is something you don’t regret doing even though it was morally/legally wrong?,"I threw a brick at a baby goose when I was young. At that time, it didn’t give shit about animals or nature at all. I feel kinda guilty now."
t3_nbz8vw,5.0,1.0,group_11,4.0,What is the dumbest “trend” that people have participated in?,"Sagging pants with your ass uncovered, and you have to walk weird or use your hands to keep them from falling down. How is this still a thing?"
t3_n2w06a,5.0,1.0,group_08,4.0,ELI5: Why are free electrons able to move around an entire object?,"Electrons are able to move around objects when the force from the nucleus holding onto the electron is overcome by some external force. When the outermost electrons are held loosely enough by the nucleus, [they will move between atoms when subjected to an electrostatic or magnetic force.](https://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/why-do-electrons-flow.html#:~:text=When%20a%20negative%20charge%20is,a%20conductor%20electrons%20are%20repelled.&amp;text=When%20electric%20voltage%20is%20applied,move%20toward%20the%20positive%20side.) A full explanation of this must start with defining the atom. [This Northwestern University physics document defines atoms as the building blocks for everything in the universe](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/science-101/what-is-an-atom.html). They are sphere-like in shape and are made up of three smaller subatomic particles.[ Protons and neutrons make up the center of the sphere called the nucleus and the electrons fly around outside the nucleus in a sort of cloud.](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/Propulsion/1-what-is-an-atom.html) A common analogy is that electrons float around the nucleus of an atom kind of like vapor droplets in a rain cloud, moving around in space while staying within the cloud itself. [The big difference between electrons and the other subatomic particles is that they are free to move around outside the nucleus](https://www.britannica.com/science/electron), which makes it easier for them to move from atom to atom. Electrons are able to move when they “break free” from the nucleus that was holding in the cloud. The only reason that they are able to do this, is because of an outside force influencing them. [Much like a moth is attracted to a flame](https://www.physicscentral.com/explore/action/dressed-to-impress.cfm), an electron is attracted to the opposite charge, typically the protons in the nucleus. But as this accredited textbook talks about, [when the attraction force to the protons of another atom is stronger than the attraction to an electron's own nucleus, the other atom will pull the electron away from its atom.](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/estatics/Lesson-1/Charge-Interactions) This will happen when a positively charged piece of metal moves close to a neutral piece of metal, some of the electrons in the neutral piece will be pulled toward the positive piece. The outside force of the positive piece allows for electrons to move around the neutral piece because it is greater than the force of the nucleus trying to hold onto the electrons. To further visualize this, see the link attached below. This concept can also be visualized by imagining there is a dog leashed to a tree. Left alone, the dog might simply be bored, walking or standing around the tree in any random location. In this scenario, think of the dog as the electron, the tree as the nucleus, and the leash indicates how tightly bound the electron is to the nucleus. As of now, the dog is free to move around the tree as he pleases, but if he were to smell a steak at the next tree over he would be immediately attracted to it. He would want to run in that direction as if the steak was a positive charge. If the dog's attraction to the steak is stronger than the leash holding him back, he'll break away from his tree and run to the next tree over. The same applies to electrons, they are attracted to opposite charges and when that attraction overcomes their attraction to the nucleus they break free."
t3_n2hebp,4.5,1.0,group_03,3.5,How do I stop feeling lonely and abandoned in lockdown?,"You just got out of a abusive relationship, that’s how it is supposed to feel. It gets worse before it gets better. And this is a win for you, if you were the abused. If not? You have a lot to work on, which you can now. Get counselling. Also you need to ask yourself why you’re craving attention from people so much or why you end up crying that much. Get curious with how you feel, start journaling. It helps with loneliness and wanting to talk to people all the time. Btw this much crying and wanting 24/7 attention is not normal. It could possibly be that you were the toxic person in the relationship because of this or this could be a trauma reaction. If this just happened it’s understandable. Give it some time. Healing takes time! Is there anything that you have enjoyed?? Go for walks it helps with the suffocating feeling, it always works for me when I’m overwhelmed. Use some of these grounding techniques. Google them, i found it useful"
t3_nbttn8,5.0,2.0,group_08,3.0,If you never had to worry about money again but you had to contribute something to society how would you contribute to society?,"Being able to pursue your true passion would be nice. I’ve always wanted to be a teacher, but the salary isn’t very appealing. Even working fast food and taking care of the store/customers/coworkers was fulfilling to me when I was younger."
t3_njwgyd,5.0,2.0,group_08,3.0,"Autistic brother is becoming violent when he becomes aggressive, what should my parents do?","The most difficult thing is for a parent not to know how to help their child and it seems like there’s more to this. Maybe he needs someone completely different from you and parents like a therapist who can talk to him and try and assess the situation before it gets out of hand. There’s also another side of it and that he could be trying to display his masculinity the only way he knows how and or there’s someone influencing him. Because he is still a minor try and talk to him and let him know that for now you are taking him phone from him not as a punishment but as a way to try and get to the bottom of whatever it is that’s bringing this change all of a sudden. Assure him that you care and love him and you only want the best for him and if there’s anything you can do to help help, talk to him without judging him."
t3_nnngh1,5.0,2.0,group_08,3.0,"Is there a limit on what you’re allowed to research, or can you do what you want as long as it gets funded?","There are limits. They will depend on the institution you work at. Generally speaking, it is the university that accepts research grants, not you as an individual, and the university can decide not to accept the money you applied for if they don’t want to support that kind of work or don’t have the infrastructure to handle it. There are going to be a lot of regulatory issues, physical space issues, security issues, etc. around those kinds of work, and a university that has already solved those issues for other people doing similar work will have a much easier time agreeing to accept another grant. A university that doesn’t already do, say, cryogenics work is less likely to be willing to set up all the necessary facilities and processes just for you. This can change depending on where you are in your career. A well established and prestigious researcher can have a lot of leverage to negotiate when changing universities. A new researcher is unlikely to find a university willing to bend over backwards to suddenly develop an explosives handling program if they don’t have one already."
