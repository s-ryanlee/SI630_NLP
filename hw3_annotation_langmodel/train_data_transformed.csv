4.0,"ELI5: Why can’t freshwater fish live in saltwater (and vice versa)?[SEP]A living cell is designed to work at specific conditions: the chemicals that make up a cell perform best at certain temperatures, with certain concentrations of chemicals, etc. This also applies to how much salt is in the cell: living things need a certain amount of salt in them in order to survive. Even if the amount of salt inside the cell stays the same, the amount *outside* the cell also matters: if the fluid around the cell is saltier or less salty than the cell itself, the cell can dangerously shrink or swell as water flows through the cell's membrane toward the saltier side. Living things have different ways of keeping the right amount of salt in their body, but they're tuned for the environments they live in. For instance, humans' urinary systems help keep the proper amount of salt in the body if they eat or drink most things, but they're unable to get rid of enough salt to survive if a human drinks nothing but seawater. Similarly, most freshwater fish aren't suited for keeping salt out of their body if they swim in sea water, and most salt water fish can't keep enough salt *in* their bodies if they swim in fresh water.",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"Referees of kids sports- what was the worst interaction you've had with a parent?[SEP]I was plate umpire for tee-ball in my teenage years. It's literally the first or second year of organized baseball. It's really just for them to learn the basics and as umps, we followed the rules but gave a lot of leeway. They're so young, who cares (parents, apparently). I have a lot of incidents from my years doing it but one stands out: This kid comes up to the plate and absolutely crushes the ball. Like he hits it so far over the other kids, they'll be chasing it for minutes (there was always one kid who could randomly do this). So kid starts his run. He runs up to first, misses the bag, gets halfway to second before he listens to his coach, turns around, goes back, touches first. The outfielders aren't even at the half way to the ball yet. Kid takes back off for second, misses the bag. Keeps going, misses 3rd. At this point he is technically out but I will let it slide if he goes back around, and touches 2nd. He continues on home, missing home as well, just kind of standing beside it when he gets there. He is now out for a second time but I still haven't singled anything. The fielding team coach is screaming at his players to get the ball to second base (so they can touch the base since that was the first one he missed). The outfielders are just starting to get the ball back towards the infield at this point. The batter how runs up the middle of the field and stands beside 2nd (still doesn't touch it). The ball comes in, kid gets tagged and I call him out. THE COACH LOSES IT He storms out to me and just starts screaming at me. I'm 14 and this grown ass man is in my face, spit and swear words flying ""What do you mean out! He crushed it! You fking idiot! You moron! That's a homerun! Or at least the double! You stupid piece of shit"" and on and on. I'm honestly a little scared but also, fuck that guy. In ump school they actually teach you how to throw out coaches, like the hand gestures and everything. I'd never thrown anyone out and again, 14, so I try to explain ""He missed 2nd, and missed 3rd which means he was technically out. He missed home, out again. He ran up the middle of the field, out again. He stood BESIDE second and then was tagged, out again. Come on, he's out and you know that"" Yeah, not good enough for him. He launches into another rant which I honestly don't really remember. All I remember is waiting for him to take a break and then getting to throw him the fuck out (with the hand gestures and a 14 year old squeaky voice ""You're out of here""). He refused to leave, so I sat against the backstop, waited till 8:15pm, called the game due to curfew, his team auto forfeited and he was barred from coaching after reports were made. I have other stories from that time and when I coached/timekept hockey and worked in a rink but that one always stood out from ""ref/ump"" days.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Like, some I completely treasure and I won't recommend them unless I know a person deserves to read them, lol. The Overstory by Richard Powers is one of those.

5.0,"How to learn philosophy without a degree?[SEP]My personal advice is to start with a critical reasoning or beginning-level logic text. This foundation will allow you to better understand the structure of arguments, understand what makes an argument valid and/or sound, learn some of the rules of inference or common fallacies. The more you practice these skills the better you will become in constructing and deconstructing arguments, seeing flaws in arguments, and offering coherent rebuttals. This will help you when you then turn to other disciplines of philosophy, because now you can read the text like a philosopher would, understanding the premises and conclusions of the argument that the philosopher is making and being able to find the weak points in the argument and either tear their argument down, or patch it up so that it can survive similar critiques. Also, critical reasoning not only helps in better understanding philosophy, but it can also help you better understand almost any other academic discipline and learn to think better in general.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Any non-fiction writers in this sub? What is the number one tip you’d give to someone wanting to write a non-fiction book?[SEP]I had a professor once that tasked us with writing a description of a tree near our classroom and thirty or so students—including myself—all failed. In one way or another, either via personification or indulgent descriptions, the class as a whole failed the very simple and basic principle of presenting to the reader exactly what the writer/author is seeing/experiencing. My recommendation is twofold. 1. I belive nonfiction is an all-in gamble where you risk writing about something boring but present the material in a compelling and captivating way. Dont let the subject of your writing dissuade you; have confidence that your voice and attention to detail will carry your narrative. 2. Strive for a rich level of texture in your writing. Your topic, whatever it is, will have its own rich history that includes places, people and significant events that played a role in crafting its present state. Each of these should be seen as opportunities to fill in the world you are presenting to the reader so dont be afraid to stray from the main narrative to share an adjacent story that better develops the focus of your topic. To conclude I think that good writing paints a picture of reality but great writing erases the detectable brushstrokes of the written word. The more effort you put into the details the easier you make it for your readership to slip into and inhabit your story. Good luck and have fun.",0,0,0,0,1.0

His adventures with the Justice League and the Legion of Super-Heroes might have given him a good understanding of time travel and multiverse related physics. His charisma and interpersonal skills are developed enough to lead and coordinate dozens of super-heroes. In older stories he created and maintained a small group of robots to guard the Fortress of Solitude and do minor tasks for him, which indicate an excellent understanding of robotics and AI. In the classic All-Star Superman he was even able to create a serum that could make humans develop kryptonian powers, showing a massive knowledge of biology and biochemistry.

5.0,"ELI5: Why does riding a bicycle feel faster than being in a car?[SEP]Your body is much better at detecting changes in speed rather than your actual speed at a given point. When you’re in an enclosed car you are mostly isolated from the elements and the factors indicating acceleration are the movement of your surroundings and the sensation of being pushed and pulled by the seat as the car accelerates and decelerates. Once you’ve been rolling along at a relatively stable 50 MPH or so, it stops feeling “fast”. When you’re on an uninclosed bike, you have the constant feeling of wind rushing over your face and dragging on your body to remind you how fast you are moving, even if you are going comparatively slow. All that being said, this will to an extent be anecdotal and someone might disagree that being on a bicycle feels faster than a car.",0,0,0,0,1.0

And this is a win for you, if you were the abused. If not? You have a lot to work on, which you can now. Get counselling. Also you need to ask yourself why you’re craving attention from people so much or why you end up crying that much. Get curious with how you feel, start journaling. It helps with loneliness and wanting to talk to people all the time. Btw this much crying and wanting 24/7 attention is not normal. It could possibly be that you were the toxic person in the relationship because of this or this could be a trauma reaction. If this just happened it’s understandable. Give it some time.

5.0,"ELi5 : Why Positive charges always are on the upper side of cloud and negative charges below it ?[SEP]So a thunderstorm has two parts that form lightning, an updraft and a downdraft. These are massive columns or air moving up/down. When that much air is being moved around it is easy for dirt or sand or dust to be picked up and thrown into the storm as well. When bits of the particulates collide they start to build up a charge, this happens enough times and you can have such a large difference in charge between particles that you get lightning. Now for the question, positive charges are not always on the top actually. There are 3 types of lightning, cloud to cloud, cloud to ground, and ground to cloud. All of these decided by where the charges are. While cloud to ground is the one we tend to notice the most it is definitely not the only kind.

What do they want? How do they try to achieve those goals? I feel like focusing on mysteriousness as away to make things interesting in writing is kind of dicey. It works reasonably well short-term, but if you can't deliver on the promised payoff, you'll lose a lot of people once that happens. Put too much focus on a character's deep dark secret, and then have it turn out to be that they dye their hair and it isn't naturally blonde will be disappointing at best. And, if you just keep teasing the audience with a mystery without closure, eventually a lot of people will get bored and wander off.

4.0,[General Vampires] Are centuries old vampires likely to be racist?[SEP]Depends on how static they are compared to humans. We lose more and more of out ability to change our worldview with new experiences as we age (combination of streamlining/optimizing processes with minimal information and the decline of neuroplasticity). But if the vampire is stuck in a youthful brain or whatever age they were made into a vamp then I imagine it would shake out with the unchanging older (physiologically) vamps getting staked because they couldn't adapt to hide in plain site anymore. The younger (physiologically) vamps being able to change with the times and duck the hunters. Likewise those vamps with more flexible minds might see where the winds blow and adjust their public facing beliefs accordingly. Now what they believe personally might vary greatly. A vamp who predates William the Conqueror may have ingrained prejudices that are simply so outdated as to be irrelevant as the peoples and places really don't exist in a way that the person of the era could recognize.,0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"Why do I feel like everyone secretly hates me?[SEP]Low self-esteem most likely. I can almost guarantee that to be the case, even if I don't know you. I will also bet you have no actual proof of them not liking you. It is all in your head. This will sound weird and arbitrary, but close your eyes and think of some really good food you like. Really try to imagine the flavours and the consistency of it. Do so for a minute. Now, if you did that, what happened? Did you perhaps feel how you had a reaction to the food? Feel the saliva in your mouth? If you imagined the food that is likely what happened. You had a bodily reaction to the mere thought of food. Same goes for anything. Yet there is no food, because thoughts are not facts and they don't reflect reality. The same is true about what you worry about. Because of low self-esteem you have this thought, but it doesn't actually correspond to reality. But you can feel the rejection and the uncertainty by the mere thought of them *not really liking you*. So you probably have to work on building up your low self-esteem. But apart from that, and until you've worked through whatever is causing your low self-esteem, try alternative thoughts whenever these thoughts of ""they don't like me"" appear. I am not telling you to just be positive instead, because if you're like most people you can't be positive all the time. Instead, remember thoughts are not = reality. So when these thoughts appear, try to shift your thought from ""they don't like me"" to ""I have a thought that they don't like me"". Then recognise that as all it is :) Good luck :)",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Question: What happens when a poison moves past the expiry date does it become more poisonous or what?[SEP]Organic toxins and poisons typically break down and degrade over time. Just about anything organic will eventually decompose or degrade over time. Snake venom loses potency over time after extraction, for example. With chemicals, it depends. A toxic chemical can become more toxic after its intended-purpose ""expiration"" date, but that's not more because the chemical loses effectiveness, not because it's a poison that became more poisonous. As a point of example, gas can go bad, but gas isn't designed to be a poison. I can't think of any examples of chemicals that get more toxic as they age, but I'm sure some exist. These are toxic, but aren't specifically branded as a poison. I would assume that any fabricated poison would either retain its level of toxocity indefinitely, or would degrade over time. A poison that got more effective over time wouldn't have an expiration date.",0,0,0,0,1.0

He ordered a junior dev to remove some crucial DB indexes which of course brought the system to it's knees on launch day. This junior dev confessed this to me , fearful and in secret. Our company had just been bought out too.

4.0,"ELI5: Why is it while driving and not paying attention, you can suddenly snap out of it and have no clue where you are?[SEP]When we first are learning to do something, we have to expend a lot of conscious attention on it. Once we get used to something, we can basically ""downgrade"" it to automatic sub-conscious actions, like muscle memory. When we get used to driving, we can do the basic steering &amp; operation of the vehicle essentially automatically...we don't need to focus conscious attention on it. As a result, the thing we \*are\* consciously focusing on (our ""locus of attention"") can wander to other things that don't involve vehicle navigation. When you suddenly pay attention enough to ask ""Where am I?"" you don't have any continuous stream of position like you would if you were paying attention and have to figure out where you are. Until you do, you literally don't know where you are. Allow me to stress that basic operation of the vehicle is \*not\* the same as ""driving"". Driving safety \*requires\* conscious attention because you need to be constantly looking for threats and assessing how you might avoid them, which you can't do automatically.

4.0,"People who experienced a very traumatic event while very young, what do you remember from it?[SEP]TW/sexual abuse (?) My (F20) family visited my paternal aunt and her sons in Paris when I was 8 I think. I was left at home with my big and small cousin and the little one played a game on his console. Me and the big cousin(M 12) went down to the backyard to play, then he proceeded to pull his pants down and peed on a wall which I didn't find *too* weird, after this he tried to pee on me and I had to actively run around and dodge it. I thiught that was it with the weird stuff as that was hibestly the weirdest shit I had ever experienced at that time but then he told me it was time for me to try this other game and suck his cock. I was really weirded out even though I didn't understand what a blowjob was at the time so I said no, I don't want to play that game. He started chasing me and telling me how it wouldn't take long and that I should listen to him as he is the older one. I just was panicked and disgusted that he wanted me to suck the place his piss just came out of and ran as fast as I could in circles on that damn backyard at first, then climbing the steps as fast as I could with him still following behind me, but I fortunatly was faster then him. I arrived at the door and knocked loudly in hopes of being let in by my little cousin and shouting for him to open up the door please, but something even better happened, instead of my little cousin my aunt opened the door, she came back to care for us now while my parents had a date in Paris with my little sis who was just like three at the time. She greeted me and asked why I was so out of breath and I just could say my cousins name and felt so ashamed that I couldn't say anything more. He came to us around then, he took more time than he should've but that was because he heard his mom talk to me and rebuttoned his pants so there was no proof. His mother asked him what he had done and he told her we were just playing a game of catch. I asked my aunt when my parents are gonna come and she told me mom and dad booked a suite for the night in a hotel and were only coming back tomorrow. She then proceeded to give my big cousin some pocket money because of how he cared *so well* for his brother and I, it was a 20€ bill. I had to sleep in the same room as my two cousins that night, fortunately in my own bed. My cousin whispered to me that I should keep quiet and not ever tell anyone about what happened. Oh and the sweet angel little cousin asked him 'what' so innocently so I just said that 'there was nothing' and he should 'go to sleep'. 7 nights I had to spend at that place, when my parents came back we all were there together and I felt pretty safe again, but every night we had to go to sleep in that room I tucked my sister in tightly beside me in our bed and hugged her. My big cousin asked her if she wanted to come to him but I just shut him down and didn't tell her what he said apart from that he just made a joke. My dad's family speaks french and my sister didn't quite understamd that yet, I was raised bilingual though so I kinda was like the translator for my little sister. I waited every night until he fell asleep before I could even think of closing my eyes in fear of him doing anything to my sister. After this he never made any advances ever again and the next time I saw him I was doing martial arts for a couple of years and felt fairly confident. I actually didn't even think about what he did as it was years ago, I was like 12 or 13 at this point. I saw him maybe 3 more times after this but since had not even had contact via social media. I never talked to my parents about this, only my boyfriend and my ex boyfriend know about this story. Sometimes it pops up in my head at random times, the way he grinned at me when telling me that I should just do it for a bit whilst he was chasing me around, sometimes it keeps me up at night and sometimes I just don't think of it at all. The most heartbreaking thing here for me was that previous to our Paris trip I genuinely missed my cousins and was really glad to get to see them again. The little one was an angel for the whole time. I thought of my big cousin as a big brother figure that I didn't have (I had two other big cousins in my home country too but I always wanted to have a big brother figure and my cousins filled that place for me).

5.0,"Have you ever been falsely accused? How did it go?[SEP]You gain a true understanding of how proving a negative is impossible. You realize that being accused isn't that much different than having done it. You are in a no win situation, people you used to believe were ""good, honest and diplomatic"" turn out to be the first to use moral judgement to feel superior. They earned that reputation by dogmatically curating public perception and shamelessly judging others under the context of innocence and moral superiority. The world is never quite the same, by your own behavior and how others treat you. There is no way to defend yourself or prove innocence that isn't judged. Seven years later when the Uncle who accused you of stealing Grandma's jewelry is grappling with dementia and his daughter posts her private pandemic wedding photos, being proven right doesn't even matter anymore. Did it ever? Not to me, he had the jewelry locked in a safe in a home he was living with his parents as a never employed 60 year old whose grifts ran dry. My twenty minute attendance at the home for the first time in years was not, could not, and should not have been so easily accepted as a criminally professional level heist. It was so dumb and shameless, to say nothing of how my lifestyle didn't change with this infusion of stolen loot. The accusing family on the other hand suddenly started traveling, paying off a family home, etc. Still, seeing my cousin wearing some of the jewelry I stole was vindication. Not like I expected though. Eventually the truth does always come out, but at that point it's hollow. I don't want a relationship with anyone who decided to accept his lies because it was easier politically and logistically in the family. The most satisfying moment was responding with a text that said ""I love your jewelry!"" Her immediate response was ""Thank you, it meant so much to have a part of Nana with me on my wedding day."" I almost felt the shift when she realized what she just said, like her ""oh fuck"" moment even hundreds of miles away. I decided it was the last time I would ever address it. I wanted everyone to see those messages and wonder? I didn't want to give them what they love, confirmation of their extreme curiosity. Did that mean what we think it did? Can't wait to watch this drama unfold. Nothing unfolded. They get that one confusing but very damning interaction, because at this point we all look worse for it, and I will not be the source of weaponized gossip fodder for other people's entertainment.

4.0,"Is the concept of 'Dao' in Daoism comparable to 'Brahman' in Hinduism?[SEP]Hi there! Daoism is my main area, and I know less about Hinduism. So I'll briefly tell you about Dao and hopefully you will be able to see if it is comparable to Brahman. Dao does not transcend the world, and it is not 'above' the world in any sense. This is true even though classic texts frequently describe Dao as the 'mother' of all phenomena (the *wanwu* or 'ten thousand things'). How can that be? Well, the best metaphor I like to use for Dao is 'ecosystem'. Picture a tree. What enables it to grow and flourish? In Daoism, the tree (like all of the *wanwu*) has a latent, inner potential (called *shi* 勢). What enables the tree to reach that potential though? Well, the rain is one thing that helps it grow. But it’s a lot more than that, isn’t it? There is a whole combination of phenomena involved: the soil quality, the worms and other insects in the soil, the evaporation that forms the clouds that make the rain, and of course the sunlight. There are a lot of phenomena involved in making the tree grow, and they form an *interconnected ecosystem*. Dao is like this. Dao is the interconnected ‘ecosystem’ of the entire universe. It is not any individual part, but the pattern of the whole. Dao is the *system itself*. This is why it is not 'above' or 'transcending' phenomena. It is the dynamic system formed amongst phenomena interacting with each other. Take me, as an example. My ‘mother’, cosmically speaking, is not just the actual woman who gave birth to me. It is the food and drink I consumed, the upbringing I received, the relationships around me, the events I participated in and the things I encountered.

4.0,"ELI5: Why are free electrons able to move around an entire object?[SEP]Electrons are able to move around objects when the force from the nucleus holding onto the electron is overcome by some external force. When the outermost electrons are held loosely enough by the nucleus, [they will move between atoms when subjected to an electrostatic or magnetic force.](https://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/why-do-electrons-flow.html#:~:text=When%20a%20negative%20charge%20is,a%20conductor%20electrons%20are%20repelled.&amp;text=When%20electric%20voltage%20is%20applied,move%20toward%20the%20positive%20side.) A full explanation of this must start with defining the atom. [This Northwestern University physics document defines atoms as the building blocks for everything in the universe](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/science-101/what-is-an-atom.html). They are sphere-like in shape and are made up of three smaller subatomic particles.[ Protons and neutrons make up the center of the sphere called the nucleus and the electrons fly around outside the nucleus in a sort of cloud.](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/Propulsion/1-what-is-an-atom.html) A common analogy is that electrons float around the nucleus of an atom kind of like vapor droplets in a rain cloud, moving around in space while staying within the cloud itself. [The big difference between electrons and the other subatomic particles is that they are free to move around outside the nucleus](https://www.britannica.com/science/electron), which makes it easier for them to move from atom to atom. Electrons are able to move when they “break free” from the nucleus that was holding in the cloud. The only reason that they are able to do this, is because of an outside force influencing them. [Much like a moth is attracted to a flame](https://www.physicscentral.com/explore/action/dressed-to-impress.cfm), an electron is attracted to the opposite charge, typically the protons in the nucleus. But as this accredited textbook talks about, [when the attraction force to the protons of another atom is stronger than the attraction to an electron's own nucleus, the other atom will pull the electron away from its atom.](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/estatics/Lesson-1/Charge-Interactions) This will happen when a positively charged piece of metal moves close to a neutral piece of metal, some of the electrons in the neutral piece will be pulled toward the positive piece. The outside force of the positive piece allows for electrons to move around the neutral piece because it is greater than the force of the nucleus trying to hold onto the electrons. To further visualize this, see the link attached below. This concept can also be visualized by imagining there is a dog leashed to a tree. Left alone, the dog might simply be bored, walking or standing around the tree in any random location. In this scenario, think of the dog as the electron, the tree as the nucleus, and the leash indicates how tightly bound the electron is to the nucleus. As of now, the dog is free to move around the tree as he pleases, but if he were to smell a steak at the next tree over he would be immediately attracted to it. He would want to run in that direction as if the steak was a positive charge. If the dog's attraction to the steak is stronger than the leash holding him back, he'll break away from his tree and run to the next tree over. The same applies to electrons, they are attracted to opposite charges and when that attraction overcomes their attraction to the nucleus they break free.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Photons have no *inertial mass*, so they're not made out of ""stuff"" in the sense we traditionally think of it. They're really packets of energy. But energy is basically the same thing as mass for... reasons... so they still react to other matter in ways that mass does.

5.0,"How do you focus on one thing at a time, so you don’t feel overwhelmed (especially when you’re juggling a lot during finals)?[SEP]I'd give myself a set amount of time per task and then follow it with a small reward. For example, I would tell myself that if I read two chapters and took notes for an hour and 15 minutes then I could get 15 minutes of watching silly tiktok videos and eating a snack. Then an hour on an assignment, followed by 10 minute reward, then an hour cleaning and so on. It helps to break things up so they seem more manageable and keep your attention. The rewards help to keep you from getting burned out and if you do the time slots at around an hour, give or take, a lot can get done and it won't really feel like you're doing all that much. If I try to sit down and read for 3 hours straight, I'll automatically feel overwhelmed and that doesn't help my concentration.

5.0,"Eli5: What determines if a metal produces an oxide layer?[SEP]I can't really do it for an actual 5 year old level, but here is an explanation: They all produce an oxide layer (noble metals aside) What matters is whether it's protective or not. By that I mean: does the oxide coating protect the underlying metal from further oxidation? And whether it does or not turns out to be largely a function of how much volume change the material undergoes when it oxidizes. If the volume change ratio is above and close to 1, it's protective, if it's any amount under, or over by too much (I forget the exact ratio, 1.5 or 2 or something?) It's not protective. Volume ratio of Aluminum to its oxide : protective Volume ratio of iron to it's oxide : not protective The mechanical properties of the oxide also have an effect if there is any sort of rubbing or wear on the surface (protective oxide that keeps getting rubbed off is not super effective) And if there is anything like salt water around, all bets are off, it'll corrode, ""protective oxide layer"" be damned!",0,0,0,0,1.0

You're hanging out with him because you literally have no idea how to tell him to piss off. Be careful how you interact with this kid. The relationship you are forming is not seen as a healthy relationship for him to have by society. You seem like a nice person but you need to nip this in the bud. Hes a child.

4.0,"ELI5 Why does genital size on humans vary so much from person to person but the rest of our organs are relatively the same size?[SEP]You're not talking about all genitals, you're just talking about one organ in particular. Nobody compares uterus size, prostate size or ovary size, only one organ is measured by size. That organ you're asking about is our good friend and our true master, known as the penis. The little general. And the answer will both shock and fail to impress you. The answer is because they don't vary in size very much at all, and because size literally doesn't matter to the females of our species. Lemmy explain why... A guy's size can only be truly measured when that thing is standing at attention. In default resting mode, it can look like anything from a limp eel to a little pimple, but erect most of them are roughly the same size. There are a few notable exceptions like Jay-Z or Tommy Lee, but those are the exceptions and not the rule. I'm considered a small guy at 5.5 inches, but a guy with just over 6 inches is considered gifted by the gods. That's not much of a difference at all, especially when you consider where it's designed to go. The female counterpart organ, also known as the vagina (or the Great Divide, the Happy Valley or the baby cannon), is an organ that even modern science can't fully explain. It's made of highly elastic tissue, elastic enough to fit an entire baby through the opening, yet when it's in default resting position it's only 4 inches deep (for a big one) and the inside walls are all touching each other. Even if after girl gives birth to her 10th baby, her VJ will quickly return to its natural size and shape. While the external appearance of the vulva may be altered by childbirth, the size and function of everything will not. Think about that... 3 to 4 inches deep, inside walls touching each other, and the rest is all elasticity. If you put your smallest finger into there, you can touch the sides in every direction and almost reach the bottom. But given enough time and effort, that thing can stretch out enough to fit a whole baby through it. No guy, not even those freaks of nature, can come even close to the size of a baby.

But I couldn't NOT do it if the book was good - for example I liked Charles Dickens and would charge through any of his books. Often they were mad because doing this would break their assignments. They might want us to use our imagination to predict what will happen next, or identify possible examples of foreshadowing before they came to pass. It was also a problem in class discussion when I would bring up things that hadn't happened yet. My favorite English teacher just modified my assignments instead of getting mad.

Why can they not do that? Much information can be gained through common sense consideration, critical thinking, and chewing over the context of the situation / matter at hand. If, after due consideration, something is still not obvious, a piece of information is missing; how then does this person seek the missing information? Do they seem to have a clue as to what is missing? Do they ask questions specifically exploring the missing piece, so that they might complete the puzzle themselves... or do they just dumbly ask for the answer to the overarching question? If a question is unlikely to be known to them or any other reasonable person in their situation, then fine, the information is genuinely beyond their grasp. But for questions that are at least partly explicable with a moment's thought, I have found this a fine predictor of not only intellect but also of academic capacity, motivation, and self-reliance. Those with intellectual curiosity tend not to ask simple / summative questions about big or complex concepts; rather, they have already been pondering the matter at hand, and are willing to ponder it further, hence asking for more detail rather than a broad--and simplified--explanation.

Think of it as pixels of a screen that the brain puts together to give a complete picture. The job of the lens in the eye is to direct light into those pixels. People with impaired eyesight usually have a lens that struggles with directing the light. As a result, each ""pixel"" recieves light from multiple directions and this gives us a blurry image.

He then went to undo the bolts but one of them was a lock nut he tried to get it off but couldn’t, so he called a friend who lived just up the road and went there to get more tools to try and get it off but it didn’t work. He then took me to a store about 15 minutes away to buy a tool to get it off, they didn’t have one and told us to go to the tire store around the corner, we went there and explained it to the people, they actually lent us the tool and said if they weren’t busy they would have come to do it. We then got back and he changed the tire I offered him money a few times but he said it was fine and wouldn’t take it, I then offered to take the tool back to the shop and he said it was ok he would take it back. I just couldn’t believe and was so grateful the length a complete stranger went to help me.",0,0,0,1.0,0
3.0,"Does any other woman feel like being feminine is something you had to grow into?[SEP]I think the reason might be that nowadays society portraits feminity or feminine characters as weak and forces( I don't think that's a good word but I can't remember anything else to replace it) them to be more masculine. Feminity is great, having characters like nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding is amazing. That's why the couples in which both the person involved only show once certain character than their relationship is unstable, I might be wrong I don't have any data to back it up.

One day I was in a different room than I was supposed to be, and this kid, who shall remain nameless (for obvious reasons) took it upon himself to throw a plastic pitcher at me and hit me right in the head. It shattered on impact and the whole class (about 15 of us) watched as all the water splashed onto me, drenched me, covered me, drowned me, held me under, etc. The whole class laughed, and laughed, and laughed some more at me. I ended up having a few chunks of dried blood in my hair for the rest of grade school. The last time I can remember getting so physically hurt was in first grade. There was this girl in my class by the name of Mary Sunshine. One day she sat in my seat. I didn't want to move, so I told her that it was my seat and I had sat there first. She just smiled at me and said that it was shared. We went back and forth on this for the rest of the day, and finally, when it was my turn to go before the teacher, I told her what was going on. She told me to tell the First Lady that it was my seat, and if she didn't like it to leave her class. Well, that was really pushing things, so when it was my turn to go before the lady she took me to the office and both of us had to stand in the hallway. She didn't even call my mom, she just took me to the office and had me and Mary Sunshine tell an adult what was going on. I don't remember why the First Lady didn't step in, but I do know that I was so glad when the bell rang to dismiss us. I had Mary Sunshine meet me after school for a long time afterward so I could tell her what happened, but I can't even remember anymore what we settled on. I do know that school was hell after that. The worst of all though was when Mary Sunshine exploded over the PA system. By herself. She sat next to me and proceeded to cry for the rest of the day while everyone made fun of me. I dunno, I'm just lucky I got out of that situation with as little physical damage as I did. I guess I have a low pain tolerance and it's only gotten worse as I've gotten older.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"For those who succeded with losing weight, how did you do it?[SEP]Good rule of thumb if you eat sorta healthy and just need to get active to drop the weight; Cardio drops body fat levels, lifting weights builds muscles, strength training like areobics or boxing is a mix in between. You can drop pounds from just focusing on cardio, but you have to do a lot more of it to compensate for not doing anything else. I work at Amazon and I'm able to track my steps from my phone, it's not super accurate but the rough estimate is nice. Slow days I walk 5mi, busy days I walk 10mi. Every slow day let's me burn about 0.5lb. Every busy day I burn 1lb. Every day you walk/run/bike/elliptical, for that similar amount of distance you can burn about a pound. You can even split up those 5-10mil into those 4 workouts so your bones and joints don't get all tensed up. Half of whatever you burn will be water, there's no way around it. Half will be fat. If you go every day consecutively and give those amounts of efforts, you can drop 10-20 pounds in 20 days straight. Even when people say that you burn less fat when you get slimmer, which is true, in which you may feel as if you're hitting a plateau, you're still able to lose weight from all of that motion. I'm not too familiar with weight training because when I was in boxing I only focused on cardio and technique, but hopefully this can help.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5 What makes some metals stronger than others?[SEP]Metal atoms are organized by arranging themselves into many repeated pieces called [unit cells](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unit%20cell). Pure metals such as iron, gold, tin, and aluminum only have one type of atom in their unit cell structure. For example, a piece of aluminum foil is made up of tons of organized aluminum atoms. Metallic alloys, such as steel, brass, and bronze all have more than one type of element in their structures. For example, steel has a mostly iron structure with carbon atoms dispersed throughout. The different crystal structures of alloys and pure metals directly affect their physical properties, such as strength or hardness. For example, pure iron (a.k.a Ferrite) forms a [body-centered cubic](https://www.lff-group.com/posts/carbon-steel-fundamentals-part-1) (BCC) unit cell, a cube with an iron atom in the center and atoms at each corner. The unit cell of steel is called [face-centered cubic](https://www.lff-group.com/posts/carbon-steel-fundamentals-part-1) (FCC) with atoms on all corners as well as faces. Generally speaking, pure metals have BCC structures and alloys have FCC structures. The Bitesize webpage of the British Broadcasting Corporation states that alloys are [harder and stronger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8db7p3/revision/2) than pure metals because there are more atoms occupying the FCC structure than the BCC structure. As seen on Professor Marzari’s illustrations of unit cells in her MIT [lecture slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lec16b_note.pdf), there are two total atoms in the BCC unit cell and four total atoms in the FCC unit cell. This difference in microstructures results in a “[greater force required \[to distort\] the layers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8db7p3/revision/2)” of atoms in alloys than in elemental metals. In other words a higher concentration of atoms leads to a stronger material. This also explains why an elemental metal like titanium, [which has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure](https://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/2004/titanium/titanium.html) (HCP) is so strong. HCP has a very tightly packed structure making it difficult to pull the atoms and move them around. There are many other factors that cause metals to be stronger than others, such as oxidation, temperature, and heat treatment, but the atomic structure is the most basic and important reason.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: How does the undo feature work in collaborative applications such as Google Docs?[SEP][Chuktropolis Welling Moran of UC San Diego](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8kg6q723) explains that different programs implement an undo feature in different ways. Recently, the undo button has evolved to accommodate collaborative text-editing systems, such as Google Docs. So what goes on under the hood? Before we learn about how a computer keeps track of undo, we must understand what a stack is. A stack is a way of storing data, where new data is added on top of old data, and the most recently added data will be removed first. This is analogous to a pile of books: the most recently added book will be on top, and it will be the first to be removed. Many implementations of undo use stacks. [Max Lynch,](https://gist.github.com/mlynch/ab554d84dc3b7b8be3d6) the CEO of Ionic Foundation, describes the undo function as a stack of operations that the user has performed. In other words, it is the ""history"" of the actions the user has taken. Whenever the user does an action, we add the action to the undo stack. When the user wishes to undo something, each action is taken out of the undo stack. Think back to the pile of books but now imagine someone wants a book in the middle. They wouldn't want to topple the pile to get the book from the middle. Instead, they would remove each book off the top of the stack, undoing what they did, until they reach the book they need. Collaborative applications implement the undo feature in a more dynamic way using stacks. In the case of [Google Docs](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/google-docs.htm), the program keeps a copy of the document on each user’s computer, and sends each change a user makes to a central server. The central server then sends a signal to all of the other users to implement the change on their copy of the document. When someone undoes an action in Google Docs, the local stack of actions on that user’s computer removes the last action. Then, that change is sent to the central server, and the data on all copies of the document are updated to reflect the undo action. The main challenge that arises when implementing this is users making changes at the same time. This could cause a number of problems, including changes being applied to the document in the wrong order. To mitigate this, [Google Drive Blog](https://drive.googleblog.com/2010/09/whats-different-about-new-google-docs_22.html) states that Google Docs implements a technique called operational transformation. In his academic [paper](https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/jan2016/Operational-Transformation-In-Co-operative-Editing.pdf), Mandeep Kaur describes operational transformation as an algorithm that “transforms” the changes being received from others relative to each user’s document. This transformation is done so that the change can be completed without editing the rest of the document. The inner workings of this algorithm are very complex, but it essentially ensures that when users make simultaneous changes, these changes (including undo) happen in the correct order. TLDR: the undo function is a list of actions that is stored on the computer. When the user either clicks on the undo button or does “Ctrl + Z/Cmd + Z” on their keyboard, it removes the most recent action in the list. In collaborative applications, there is a local list of actions on each user’s computer which can be used to undo the latest action of the user. Processes such as Operational Transform apply these changes in a central server and merge actions to create simultaneous undo actions.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Light switches for example are supposed to switch the hot wire, not the neutral one, because otherwise a light fixture that's turned off at the switch would still potentially be dangerous to work on. The core idea here is that voltage is always relative. If you take an AA battery and you touch the negative terminal of it to a metal pipe in your house, then the positive terminal of the battery is now at +1.5V relative to the (earthed) pipe.

Rather, virtue is a character trait. In virtue ethics, what you are striving for is not acting in an honest way, acting in a courageous way, etc. Rather, what is important to virtue ethics is **being** honest, **being** courageous, etc. If you have those as part of your character, then you will naturally act virtuously. You gain these virtues by fostering them, which is usually by understanding the virtues and practicing them through your actions. However, if it is for a personal philosophy, I do not see anything wrong in imposing on yourself a duty to act consistent with a virtuous manner. Though, a problem with virtue ethics is that many accounts fail to specify what acts are consistent with virtue and give the actor guidance such as ""act as a virtuous person would.""

So we were just talking about whatever, and then the oldest suddenly takes off her bathing suit. I guess getting naked is considered funny to them since it’s seen as taboo by adults. Anyways, I got a super awkward boner. I think it was registering the fact that I was seeing a naked lady, and not taking in account her age at that exact moment. Same happening with the youngest. I kind of awkwardly laughed it off before I told them to put their clothes back on, which they did. But, a part of me wanted to see them nude again. I don’t know why. They did, but I quickly snapped back to reality and told them to put their clothes back on. They’re kids for crying out loud. Thankfully, my dumb strange horny ass didn’t do anything.

5.0,"ELI5: How linear are the planets in our solar system?[SEP]It’s seems counter intuitive but yes all the planets almost line up perfectly in the same plane if you looked at the solar system from the side. All the planets are on a plane within 7 degrees of the centre of the sun and also basically orbit around the suns equator. Mercury is the outlier here it’s over 6 degrees out of plane, if you ignored Mercury the other planets are within I think 2 degrees of the sun. This same planar formation is what we have observed in every solar system that we can see that clearly. The reason is the physics of the solar systems formation. In the most basic way when a solar system forms, the gas cloud that makes it will not be a perfect sphere, it’s irregular shape means that as it collapses it will start to form into shape like a disc with a blob in the centre. The blob collapses into a sun, the disc starts to form rings that collapse into planets and bam, everything almost in a single plane.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: How is Wi-Fi ""shared"" to multiple devices?[SEP]When a device ""talks"" to your router, what it's doing is, in a kind of way, ""flashing"" a light on and off that the router can ""see"". This light is pretty dim so it can only be seen clearly a few dozen meters or so away. It can penetrate through some walls but maybe only one or two before it gets really hard to see. Your wireless router is a bit like your own eyes in the sense that it can pick up a small range of different light frequencies. That is, it can ""see"" a few different ""colors"". When a device tries to connect to your Wi-Fi router, it will sit back and look at everyone else in the room and see which colors they're flashing in. Then, it will try to pick a color that is different from everyone else, and flash in that color. Your router should be able to see all the different flashing colors at the same time, and it's able to tell them all apart because it can separate out the colors. This can break down if you have too many devices, however. Like, two devices might be trying to flash in colors that are very close shades to one another. If you mix it with poor signal quality that can distort the colors, the router might get confused when the two devices try to talk at the same time, and it might ask them to repeat themselves. This is one way a router can ""slow down"" when too many people connect. In general, your router can maybe handle four or five devices ""talking"" at the same time before the colors start to collide with each other.",0,0,0,0,1.0

The index itself is kept in a known location so it can be read directly. For disks like a compact disk or hard drive, the disk is physically moved with a motor until the area with the file is under the reading head.

My partner (M) orders coffees, goes to sit outside at a table. I ask for the toilet, and get sent upstairs (!) to the mezzanine. It’s all men upstairs too, watching a match on tv. Heads turn, they go silent. I go for the “toilet” in a corner. This toilet, a small room (2meters long by 1m wide) on a corner of the mezzanine, could have been a wardrobe. Or a storage space. It’s small. Turkish-style toilet (hole on the floor), hadn’t been cleaned since 1980 or so. Things float in there. The smell.. sour. There is no window, no vent, but most importantly, the light doesn’t work. Men stare at me as I enter. The door doesn’t close well either!

I stumbled upon a mushroom cultivation timelapse video in youtube a while ago, seeing them grow into weird shapes from microscopic spores is amazing. So I looked for more, that's when I fell in the rabbit hole. Getting into mushrooms stuff, or mycology, is easy, although not as easy as getting a small plant, planning ahead and patience is the key to quality mushroom. The majority of mushrooms/fungi are quite suitable for indoor cultivation, they can be very low maintenance if the environment is accomodating enough. If you are fascinated by fungi's diversity and how unique some mushrooms look, and growing has been a success, then you're ready for the next level. That's harvesting, isolating, and even mixing the genes of mushrooms you find interesting. This means you can end up with a strain that grows super fast, or one that has unique colors, or one that's just big. Since the lifecycle of mushrooms are fairly short, the influence of selective cultivation can be visible in a relatively very short timeframe, when compared to animals and plants. Also I noticed you make music from the post, MycoLyco[MycoLyco](https://youtu.be/J-nIBA0V_No) from youtube uses mushroom as his instrument to play MIDI, so that's cool. Some mushrooms can be grown for food, for medicinal use or just for the view. There's quite a few awesome subreddits (such as r/mycology, r/mushroomgrowers) and youtube channels ([Philly Golden Teacher](https://youtube.com/c/PhillyGoldenTeacher), [90 Second Mycology](https://youtube.com/c/90SecondMycology)) that have a lot of information on this subject, as well as people who are more than happy to help others learn.

However the Planet that actually gets the closest to us is Venus. 7 Month from now Venus will be as close to us as any planet ever gets and in October last year Mars was closer than any other planet. When you ask what Planet is closest to us right now it is always Mars, Venus or Mercury with Mercury being the answer most often. It all depends on where in their orbits the planets are. If one of them is on the same side of the sun as us and the other two are on the far side of the sun, that is the closest. Mercury has the advantage that even if it is on the far side it is not that much farther away, because it orbits so close to the sun.

The loss comes out of their bonus so they are incentivized to cheat wherever they can. There was also this attitude of appearing perfect. Stores are scored on a system of points that an auditor goes through and scores. Some things they took off the computer screen, like service times (how long it takes to make each item and how long It takes for delivery drivers to clock back in) so managers will fly around the store skipping through all the steps to have the computer read it as finished before they even start. Seems harmless until you have an order say it's been delivered but they actually forgot to make it at all.

Otherwise it would be trivially easy for any outsider to clog up your entire mailbox (or even the entire server) just by sending huge mail which ""eat up"" all available storage. On a very basic level, the mail protocol works like this: * You create a message with a recipient address * You hand over the message to your local post office (your own mail server) * The postal service forwards the mail to the recipients post office (their mail server) * Their post office stores the message in the recipients post box (inbox) * The recipient eventually collects the mail from their post box There's no guaranteed delivery in this.

Now, the public views pro wrestling as ridiculous and even the people getting into pro wrestling seem to think all you have to do is some silly flips and comedy routines to succeed as a pro wrestler. It's a business that's went from being respected to viewed as a complete joke even by the so-called fans who really just want to see whatever ridiculous stunts the wrestlers will pull on each show and do their ""HOLY SHIT!"" chants and who have no interest in seeing any actual wrestling. It's not because it's ""fake"", it's because the people on top consistently chose shock value silliness that would allow them to profit more in the short-term over the credibility that would've given less short-term profit but been more maintainable in the long term.",0,0,0,1.0,0

The head does a good job of dampening and deepening the voice you hear when talking. The rest of us however don't hear that ""inner"" sound, we just hear what comes out of your mouth. When you hear your own voice via video for instance you suddenly hear your voice as everyone else hears it, without the full sound that you're used to.

5.0,"How successful or unsuccessful are arranged marriages as compared to love marriages objectively in terms of emotional satisfaction and financial stability? What if demographics like India are not considered where societal pressure is more?[SEP]I think this really depends on what your expectations are for marriage in the first place. Arranged marriage works surprisingly well, from what I've seen, among peoples who take a very practical and unromantic view of marriage — it's a bilateral contract for helping maintain the community's population, no more no less. In a lot of these cultures, many people are perfectly OK with their spouse not being their most salient interpersonal relationship, and consider it a bonus if they *ever*, never mind deep into the relationship, find their spouse highly sexually attractive. No, the goal of a successful match in cultures with strong traditions of arranged marriage, is the matching of two successful business partners, who complement each other well in working together toward a common goal (raising children, caring for the elderly, and promoting communal cohesion). I've heard Asian people say, ""Of course Westerners get divorced commonly. They expect waaaaaay too much from marriage!""",0,0,0,0,1.0

That is why you get these strange numbers. The atmosphere is not able to support sounds of over about 180 dB because at that point you start creating complete vacuum. This is why lound noises like rocket launches sounds like they are recorded on a broken microphone, it is not the microphone that is broken but the air itself. So these numbers you are quoting can not possibly be recorded accuratly or even calucated after the fact because they just did not happen like that. So when comparing lound noises like volcano eruptions and rocket launches you have to take into account how large of a volume they can create that sound in. So you calculate a total energy output instead of a dB number. And the bigger the explosion, the more energy in it, the louder the sound will be at a fixed distance where the sound can actually be measured and make sense.",0,0,0,1.0,0

The rotomphone was similarly designed to interface with a rotom, and these features were not included. My guess as to why a designer would want a talking Pokédex but not a talking phone is that way the Pokédex could act as a guide and offer information with greater ease. We see in the anime that the original Pokédex talks to the trainer to offer advice and information, and the Rotomdex goes a step further by replacing the AI with a rotom.

5.0,"ELI5, Why do bike tires need 90-110 PSI, while much heavier cars tires need only around ~35 PSI?[SEP]My truck has tires at 100psi. It's about weight and contact area. As others have said, PSI = pounds per square inch, and the force accumulates over the surface area. If you have a 12"" by 12"" plate in your hand and I magically exerted a downward pressure on that plate of 1psi, you'd feel a force of 144lbs. If I increased that to 35psi or 100psi you'd feel 5,040 and 14,400lbs of force respectively...on an object that's roughly the size of a sheet of paper. You can see that pressure adds up quickly over a surface area. In the case of a tire, that force is wrapped around the perimeter of the tire to balance itself out and keep it inflated, while the tire compound and belting are under heavy tension load. A bike tire at 100 psi has fewer square inches to develop force. A car tire has far more surface area and the resultant force of 35 psi is quite large. My truck tire is even larger than a car tire and it's at 100psi because my truck is massive and has a large towing capacity. The point here being that whatever portion of your car tire is currently touching the road has a force distributed over it that's equal to the weight on that tire. What you're balancing here is tire deflection. If I have a 100psi truck tire and inflate it to 35psi, it'll still hold my truck just fine, but the tire is a little squished down. If you look at one small ""pizza slice"" of tire from the rim out to the tread, as it rotates around it's one size, and then squished down when it goes over the road, and then stretches back out again. At higher speeds this squishing and stretching happens rapidly. Have you ever stretched a rubber band a bunch or some silly putty and then felt how warm it got? There's friction in the tire compound and it creates heat. Running underinflated tires causes them to heat unnecessarily from all the squishing and stretching, and if they're a little older they might already have small cracks in them and you're far more prone to blowouts. Tire pressures are determined by the strength of the compound, the surface area of the tire, the contact patch area with the ground, and the weight and speed of the intended vehicle. My offroad tires are *very* low pressure because I want as much contact patch area as possible. You're basically running on tires with a few puffs of air more than being flat. And they're great! But if you start driving at 90mph on those while towing a trailer, you'll blow them out. Similarly, if you have high pressure semi trailer tires and you try to offroad with them, your contact patch isn't nearly as good and you'll get stuck.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"Eli5 space-time continuum for a dummy, does it physically exist or is it just a mathematical model created to picturise gravity?[SEP]We use models to explain things. We might hold up a ping pong ball and say, this is like the earth. We might then put a toothpick through the ping pong ball to show how the earth rotates. We might use a flashlight to represent the sun, and then tilt the toothpick to represent the poles, etc. Sometimes we use a two-dimensional model of a three-dimensional thing. For instance a drawing that shows a farm house in the foreground, a barn in the middle ground, and tiny cows in the background. We can also use a three-dimensional model to represent a four-dimensional thing like showing how a cube can unfold into six connected squares and then show eight cubes in a cross and explain that this is what a hyper-cube looks like when it is unfolded into three-dimensional space. How do these models relate to space time? Well space-time is a four-dimensional construct. it contains within it 3d of space and 1d of time. We can't easily represent 4d items to our 3d brains. We can ""prove"" that space time compresses and expands and works in relation to speed on any arbitrary reference point (General relativity / gravity) but we have a hard time explaining it because we don't have any ""good"" ways of visualizing it. Now ""does it exist or is it just math?"" is a really big question. Every PHYSICAL TEST we have come up with and every MATHEMATICAL TEST we have come up with say that our MODEL of relativity MATCHES what we can test for in REALITY. BUT is it ""REAL"" ??? Science can never say for certain that something is REAL. We can only come up with better and better models. For instance we used to accept that Newton's idea of Gravity was ""REAL"" because we had no tests that we could conduct that said it wasn't. Then we found some tests that showed newton's Model for how gravity work failed to take into account things moving near the speed of light. His model broke down there, but Einstein's model doesn't break down. In fact Einstein found the math first, and then we developed the physical tests much later. Is the current ""Theory"" or accepted law, about gravity 100% correct. No. It breaks down at the quantum level. So maybe there is a better model out there that will more more closely fit all aspects of reality. But is the model of gravity we have right now including space-time accepted as ""REAL"" for anything larger than the quantum scale? Yes.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5, Where did dating come from? Or the idea of dating in which you have to go out and do something with someone else to court them?[SEP]Dating can be seen as virtually any activity done between two people to spend time together. It can be going over to their house to watch a movie together, going hiking, going out to eat, going to play mini-golf, etc. The very act of ""people hanging out with each other and if they liked each other, great"" is a form of dating. Beyond that, many activities, like going bowling or something, costs money and is easier to coordinate if both people are going in the same vehicle. If you and someone else make plans to go bowling, for example, you *know* they won't be late if you go together in the same vehicle, you *know* exactly where they are instead of looking for them once you arrive, etc. It also allows people who have regular, busy lives, to set plans for a future date when they're both available. If you find potential partners/friends *only* by ""running into each other at some mutual location/event"", you're extremely limiting the people you meet and *also* putting a lot of faith in the random chance that you meet them again in the future, rather than specifying a *date* and time to see them again. I think the concept of ""a date"" being something where you specifically go pick someone up and take them somewhere specifically just to see if you like spending time together, is quite limiting on what a date can be.

If no pregnancy occurs, that is expelled out through her regular monthly period. Pregnancy can change the uterus of to make it permanently larger, meaning more tissue and blood to expel every month. Pregnancy can also cause the lining to become permanently thicker, with the same result. Endometriosis (uterine tissue being found outside the uterus in the abdominal or pelvic cavity) can occur before or after pregnancy, and this uterine tissue will attempt to shed just like normal uterine tissue but has nowhere to go and is often located in places that have more nerve endings, causing more pain.

Do not feel bad about being angry, or upset. You deserved better, and got unlucky. Do not compare your situation to others, it doesn't lessen what you are going through, only makes you less likely to seek help. You are valid, and deserve to be heard.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I laughed and said very good I've never heard that one before, so asked again what she wanted to drink and she repeated that she wanted gin and toilet water. At this point i could see she was being serious and thought she was an absolute weirdo. After some back and forth she changed to gin and lemonade. Just as I was walking away it dawned on me that she might have been saying ""tonic water"". For context I studied abroad for college and sometimes struggled understanding the accent. She had indeed been saying tonic water not toilet water as I thought. I was mortified but tried to laugh it off, they did not laugh at all. Surprisingly enough they did not tip lol.

Any of the molecules your body uses or produces are recognized as “self” molecules. Any other molecules are therefore recognized as “non-self” molecules and your body has methods to dispose of them. Sometimes immune cells engulf the non-self molecules, sometimes enzymes break them down, sometimes they just can’t get past your cell membranes.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"ELI5: why is ceramic useful as body armor when ceramic mugs shatter really easily?[SEP]1) Material. The ceramic they use in mugs are often made of clay material, terracotta, porcelain, that kind of things. While ceramic armor are made of material like silicon carbide and such. Even if both are ceramic, they don't have the same proprieties. It's like comparing bronze to steel, both are metal, but that don't act the same way. 2) Size. Pottery are often thin, while ceramic armor can weight up to 8 pounds and their thickness is measured in inches. The more material you have the more it can survive stress. The same reason why a bullet will go straight through your windows at home, but will be stopped by an inch of glass. 3) You are right that ceramic seem fragile, but that doesn't really matter. When a bullet hit the ceramic it will shatter it into small pieces, but that's the point. All the force of the bullet will go through all those fractures and dissipate the force. The ceramic will be useless after that, but the job is done. Now well done ceramic plate is made like a sandwich with different material so that the ceramic plate don't get destroyed in one shot. They try to achieve a balance with different layer, so the ceramic shatter to dissipate the impact, but the shattering is limited by the other layer to a small area, so that the plate can survive more than one impact.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Some funnels don't appreciably shrink downward: the EF4 that hit Greensburg KS was roughly evenly cylindrical all the way down. It has to do without how the air column is able to move the air and debris around it. As the funnel descends, it takes more and more energy to maintain it the farther from the cloud it extends, thus there is less kinetic energy - less air movement - at the bottom than the top.",0,0,0,0,1.0

By cooking it you break down the hard to digest parts and you get more out of it while expending less resources in the process. This leaves more for other parts of your body.

Helping really depends on what their goals are/what their strengths are. If it's a hobbyist who just likes playing with some story they thought of, helping is just saying ""cool"" and maybe listening to them talk about it. If it's someone hiring me to help them become a better writer, then there's a lot more teaching that can be done (I mean... there are years worth of lessons just to get the basics covered). Differs from person to person. Some need confidence. Some need discipline. Some need a reality check. I'd say one of the biggest things to get across has always been that writing is a skill.

5.0,"ELI5: what makes ankle joints withstand age-related wear and tear, comparatively speaking?[SEP]The magic of the ankle biomechanics is more-so in the synergy it has with the foot than simply the ankle itself. The ankle-foot complex (AFC) is an extremely intricate &amp; complex structure with a high concentration of bones and muscles, connected by very supportive and flexible Connective Tissue (Tendons, ligaments, fascia). With the AFC being the first load-Bearing system of the body, we expect these Connective tissues to be far more responsive and adaptable to the stressors imposed from our body and the changing terrain. While the hips may have stronger ligaments than the ankle, the ankle has an uncanny ability to adapt to the changing environment because of the foots ability to evenly distribute the load evenly before sending the force upstream. Summing this up, the Ankles ability to alter its compliance based on the terrain it’s interacting with may cause it be more resilient to the less compliant hip joint.",0,0,0,0,1.0

There’s proof that Russia does its best to manipulate social media, and the fact that Russia wants devolution tells you it’s a bad idea for the western world. I’ve been to many places in Scotland (mostly western) and I adore the place and the people. The idea of needing a passport to go there saddens me.

However, in general they all come to the ability for the atoms of that substance to move past each other without breaking the bond they have. One of the most interesting phenomena is the one you'll see in metals that can bend. We like to think of metals as one evenly spaced mass of atoms. However the truth is metals will form crystals within their structures. At the borders of these crystals there are bonds that are stretched and barely holding on. When you bend the metal, the force you are applying slides those crystals past one another, moving that stretched space along the mass of the metal until it reaches the edge. This is why if you bend a paperclip back and forth enough times you will snap it. You've accumulated enough of those stressed bonds at the edges that the mass can't hold together. Larger crystals in metal make less stressed bonds which makes that metal less malleable because the crystals can't slide past each other.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Is it possible to even define the self ?[SEP]In some sense you described the philosophical view of Spinoza. It is true that you can't really seperate what you are from the world, they constantly interact, exchange, and flow back and forth. Spinoza basically just decided then that everything is one Substance, literally everything in the world is one, and that the things we experience are different modes and attributes of the one Substance. A development of Spinoza is the philosopher Deleuze, who tries to answer another question you put fourth: how can it be things are both seperate and one at the same time? How do we make sense of the unity of the world and the various differences that obviously exist in it? You also speak to the question of qualia which basically is the undescribable aspect of experience. Spinoza's Ethics and Deleuze's Difference and Repetition are books you might be interested in. You asked alot of questions and raised many interesting points that many people have spent their whole lives trying to answer, and I can't answer them for you or correctly, but hopefully directing you towards Spinoza as starting point and bringing up the question of qualia is helpful If these questions really trouble you these key terms might be useful to helping you find some answers on your own",0,0,0,0,1.0

Maximum working age to remove older people from the workforce on a schedule, which makes room for new and young workers just beginning their lives as employees. It's unfair for someone to work past retirement age. They are keeping that job from someone younger who needs the money. Social support for the elderly would prevent them from having to keep a job past retirement. Homelessness is illegal. No one is allowed to be homeless. If they are, they will be helped. We will take care of those struggling knowing full well that some will never be able to take care of themselves. Some will, and some of those people will become huge assets to society.

5.0,"ELI5: If lipids have twice as much energy as carbohydrates, why is glucose used in respiration?[SEP]Technically, what's used in respiration is a thing called an acetyl group, which is two carbon atoms with some extra bits. This is what is processed by the mitochondria into CO2, water and a bunch of energy, and the energy ""value"" of a calorific molecule is just a matter of how good that molecule is at providing acetyl groups. Lipids are long chains of carbon atoms. Every two carbon atoms can easily be snapped off and converted into an acetyl group and carried to the mitochondria. That's really efficient for storing energy, then. Glucose is 6 carbon atoms, but it can only make two acetyl groups due to the way the cell converts glucose. Comparing carbon atoms, glucose makes 4 ""useful"" carbon atoms out of 6, but lipids can make 4 useful carbon atoms out of 4, which is a much better ratio. The unique benefit of glucose is that some energy is also produced from anaerobic respiration. Glycolysis, the process of converting glucose to pyruvate (the step just before acetyl), releases a small amount of energy even before the mitochondria get involved, but it also uses up a limited resource called NAD. This NAD gets contaminated with hydrogen, and for glycolysis to continue, it needs to be cleaned. Fortunately, the mitochondria can take the hydrogen off the NAD and convert it into energy and water molecules. That's what's happening in aerobic respiration. Unfortunately, they need oxygen to do it, cos you can't make water out of just hydrogen. When oxygen isn't available, the body can still refresh NAD, but all the energy that was in the contaminating hydrogen gets lost, instead of converted into usable form. That's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and glucose's ability to be better than nothing in poor conditions is really useful. Glucose is also the only thing that nerve cells use for fuel. We're not entirely sure why that is, but some good theories exist around things like glucose metabolism doing less damage to cells, being faster, and requiring less oxygen even when aerobic respiration is available (a lot of oxygen is burned in lipid -&gt; acetyl conversion).",0,0,0,0,1.0

I guess the last and biggest one was right before I left (for this reason, among others). One of the owners had been sleeping with an employee off and on. That employee was married at the time, and her husband worked there as well. Not only that, but her husband effectively built the place with his own two hands. Dude was a very skilled mechanic/maintenance dude, pretty much did everything and everything, and was a large reason the business was successful (they wouldn't be able to afford having contractors come out and do it ""by the books"". Not only that, but the husband drove CDL for them, risking a lot because he hasn't had his DOT physical in forever either, so he had to dodge around the backroads, hoping to never be in an accident or run into an unexpected weigh station. Best part? The owner would go over to their house and literally eat this mans food in front of him, knowing he was fucking his wife. If this were to get out, it'd do a lot of damage, as a lot of people were confused as to what she even did there, and they knew there was some hard favoritism involved in her keeping her job. Best part? The friend who told me about this is now dating the owner. Not only that, the owners more than 20 years older than her. As I told her would happen, she was made a manager and got a decent raise within a couple months of dating him. That's just one story of many I've had from that place, many of which dealt with workers rights and other legal issues they attempt to skate around. Sadly both owners have zero experience running a business, no education or anything in that matter.

I said ""The chances of that are really low, I'll wait"" As time goes by, my pain got worse with every move I made, even though I have a high pain tolerance, it got so severe that I was holding in screams of pain because of how awful it was. I couldn't take it anymore, I knew something was wrong, and my legs would randomly give out, even though I can't feel my legs, how often it was, was unusual. Got xrays and ct scans and within the next week I had 2 surgeries to fix it (late 2020) And my spine wasn't fused, I twisted several vertebrae, there were bone chunks free floating, and the rods were so loose they could jiggle. And I had to suffer that without pain medication, all I could have was Tylenol, despite evidence I was suffering, all because ""I'm 15"" I have a feeling that if I didn't get it fixed that soon, I would have irreversible damage to both my nerves, and my spine.

We are coming to a point where our ability to project our presence into the broader galaxy. Given the fact that we have not heard anything from anyone else, and how long the galaxy has been around, there is a sense that it is not possible for a species to progress much further than we are now. There might be some great filter that will prevent us from proceeding. Possibly catastrophic climate change. That is just speculative. There is also a statistical probability that we are closer to the end. Given how fast the population has grown, how many people have lived before us, and how many are living now, and how many will be living in a hypothetical future, the odds on you randomly being born in that 'elbow of the curve' are slim. So there must be something that stacked the odds in favor of you being born now, ie this is the most people there will ever be.

Such a feature may arise either by random mutation, or it may be something that an ancestral organism had which has since lost its usefulness. Sometimes such features atrophy and disappear over many generations, but not always. In the case of T-rex, its ancestors possessed four limbs for walking in a four-limbed fashion. At some point in its evolution, T-rex's ancestors adopted an upright stance. The front limbs don't just vanish, even if they're not used for anything at all any more.

So here are some key points: 1. Your performance will be taken more into consideration, that your tenure. Your argument of ""I have been here 10 years"" will not matter if you are an underperformer. 2. Companies have to take care of internal equity. Just because in other companies are paying more in the same role you have, they can match the salary. If someone in the same position you have (in your current company) makes less than you do, and conditions are equal (performance, Tenure, results etc). Chances are you are not going to get it. 3. Be civilized about it. Demanding and insulting to get it will not work. 4. Make a solid business case on why you deserve a raise.

But if I knew for sure that it was fated for me now to be ill, I would even seek [illness]. For my foot, if it had brains, would seek to be muddied. The fact that the Stoics often make it seem like our choices are un-determined got them into a lot of hot water in antiquity. This was more the case with the Greek Stoics, especially Chrysippus, who reportedly wanted to have it both ways (i.e., hold both that everything is determined and that somehow our choices were not determined) than it is with the Roman Stoics, such as Epictetus. So much scholarly ink has been spilled trying to make sense of the Stoic theory of freedom and responsibility in the face of their determinism that it is truly impressive! When I teach the Stoics to undergrads, this is always the biggest stumbling block. I do think that Chrysippus came up with a coherent way out of dilemma but it is tough to explain. People like Epictetus are much clearer that even our choices are determined. The most important thing you can remember is that even in a deterministic worldview, we still choose things. We choose things as much as we raise our arms, go to sleep, etc.: all of these things still happen, but they're determined.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I remember looking into an empty coffin in the dream, and it suddenly hit me. The second I became aware that I was dreaming, I was in full control. It was unbelievable. I remember flying over my home town, and it felt completely real. I lost track of time, but I think it lasted a while, maybe 15 minutes or so. When I woke up I was so excited that I had actually done it that I couldn’t go back to sleep for the rest of the night. That was months ago now. Since then, I’ve had two more lucid dreams. In one, I was looking into a mirror, and my reflection was looking up at the ceiling. I became lucid for about 5 seconds before waking up. I don’t remember how I became lucid in the second one, but that also only lasted for a few seconds. I’ve tried so hard to have an experience that compares to the first lucid dream, to no avail. It was so unreal and amazing and I want to badly to do it again. It seems like I can only do it when I’m not trying to. It’s really frustrating.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It's in charge of doing the rest of the startup - things like ""let you log in"". The controversy comes from the fact that systemd also does a *lot* of other things - like ""run background processes"" and ""manage network connections"". To a lot of Linux users/developers, there's a deeply-held philosophy of ""each program should do one thing and do it well"". People got upset about systems switching over to systemd completely - they wanted to be able to pick and choose. There's some connected concerns about a lot of systemd being designed/implemented by a small group of people. At this point, a lot of the controversy has died down - people have mostly settled in with the fact that systemd exists and is at least alright at what it does.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"ELI5: How is a co-dopant chosen while doping a nanoparticle? Can any pair of elements be used as co-dopants depending on the required properties?[SEP]Three factors to keep in mind are crystal structure, number of electrons, and energy levels. You usually want a dopant that doesn't change the crystal structure too much - meaning it should either be a similar size to the atom it's replacing, or be much smaller so it can sit between atoms (this is called an interstitial). Usually the dopant will have a different number of valence electrons than the atom it's replacing, and the difference determines whether it adds or removes electrons (p-type vs n-type). The energy levels of the nanoparticle (HOMO and LUMO) and the energy levels of the dopant determine the doping efficiency - which is the fraction of dopants that actually dope the material. Energy levels also determine what the nanoparticles actually do, especially if you're absorbing or releasing light.",0,0,0,1.0,0

It would have access to being able to pay the bill, whichever bills you set up for it to pay. And I imagine it working something like this. You get paid on a Friday. And it's time to pay your utility bills. On screen it would show you that you owe $75 to electric, $50 to gas, $100 to cable, and what not. Then you would simply press the green button to pay each one of the bills that you want paid. And instead of having to log in to each and every business you owe money to, by simply pressing the pay button, that money is taken out of your account, the bill gets paid, and receipts are generated. I also see the app as being able to handle cash flow. So let's say I need $500 from each check in order to make rent. If I get one check that is $700, I don't have $700 to spend, I only have $200 to spend. And if app knows I owe $50 to an electric bill, I don't have $200 to spend I only have $150 to spend. So if I asked my app what my available balance is, it would not tell me that I have $700 it would tell me I have $150. I've never seen an app like this.

5.0,"ELI5: How do antihistamines treat eye allergies, if the irritants are literally in the eye?[SEP]When your eyes are itchy from pollen in spring time, it is caused by the cells of your immune system noting the pollen and recognizing it as harmful to you. A lot of different cells are involved with this immune response but ones with the ""big guns"" are called mast cells. They come on the scene and release histamine, which works to stop the pollen from doing any damage to you. Unfortunately histamine is really really itchy, so you can take an antihistamine to keep more mast cells from planting more histamine. You're right about the pollen leaving the eye through tears - that's what tears and blinking are supposed to do! The problem is that your body has already triggered the immune response, so even after the pollen is gone, it still takes some time for all the immune who were called in for battle to arrive, do their thing until no more threats are detected, then retire to the bloodstream.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: Exactly how do genes mutate?[SEP]There are different reasons for genes to mutate. Three of the most common ways are 1. Your DNA is kinda like a rope ladder with instructions for different things on each step. Radiation act as a cannon ball and come blast away a part of that ladder. Now when your cell tries to read that to do its function, it screws up and you end up with cancers. 2. Your cells are constantly dividing. One of the part that needs to divide is the DNA, so both cells can have the same copy. How that happens is that both the DNA strands are pulled apart, and then the 2 halves are made into 2 whole by adding material to the 2 strands/halves. During this process, it's possible a wrong part is added in the wrong place. And that is another mutation. 3. Third is that when your reproductive cells divide, they also mix and match a few things. This is why you don't have exactly one parent's pure trait or the other, but can have a mix of things. Sometimes, these mix and match can happen with an error. So a part which wasn't intended to be cut, gets cut off, or is matched with a part not matched with before. And you get mutations we see in children where they have something their parent doesn't.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5: Why is taylor swift re-recording her albums?[SEP]She signed over the rights to her future 6 albums to Big Machine Records, her record label, when she was 15. She made those 6 albums, then left. She wanted to purchase her albums, but they refused - the only deal they would make was for her to ""earn"" one old album for every new album she turned in. Then the rights were sold to Scooter Braun, who Taylor has beef with - for one thing, he was Kanye West's manager at the time Kanye commissioned a wax figure of Taylor's naked body for a music video, something a manager would be involved in. He also bragged about ""buying"" Taylor Swift. Obviously, she wasn't pleased, and refused all licensing offers (for use of her songs in TV, film, etc) - ensuring that Braun would only make money from streams and sales, which are pennies compared to licensing deals. This also meant that she wasn't making money from licensing deals, and it also meant that her music wasn't being used in other media, something she wanted to happen from an artistic standpoint. So she's re-recording all her old work, so that her new versions can completely replace the use of the old ones. They're similar enough that no movie producer is going to care if they get the new one instead of the old one, and since it's their only option, they will. Much of why she's re-recording is to make a statement - many of the songs she's re-recorded will never be licensed, but she wants to COMPLETELY own her work. It's at least as much a creative decision as a business one. Her disagreement with her record label is a) them not letting her purchase her catalog, b) them selling her work to Scooter Braun (for the reasons named above), and c) them stifling her creatively for years, which is why she left in the first place - they initially parted on good terms, but considering how much she emphasizes her creative freedom with her new label, it seems that these things have added up enough for her to care. She is still making money off the sales of both the new and old versions.",0,0,0,1.0,0
5.0,"Is it wrong for a movie director to tell an actor EXACTLY how to deliver a line?[SEP]What you're referring to is a ""line reading."" Sometimes an actor asks for that. ""Can you give me a line reading?"" Matt Damon did a [funny fake bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3TFNIqIqPM) with the Entourage guys that involved a reference to it. I'm not expert movie man from king fuck mountain, but I've worked a lot of sets and it really depends on the people involved, and the kind of project. On a commercial, where lines are very specific, line deliveries aren't uncommon. In film, where dialogue is a bit more organic based on emotion, it's all about the comfort levels of the director and actor. An old acting coach of mine spoke about a moment on the set of A Few Good Men when Rob Reiner gave Jack Nicholson a line reading during the court scene and Nicholson just responded with, ""Oh... well I guess I'm just not there yet.""

5.0,"Why is revenge shunned upon mostly as to individual upon the individual?[SEP]The short answer for why revenge is wrong is that acting out revenge makes things worse and not better. In the social sphere, one of the foundational justifications for having institutions of law is to prevent individuals from pursuing revenge themselves. There are dozens of reasons we don't want social order to depend on the enactment of revenge, but one of the most important is that settling scores through revenge doesn't tend to end matters, and one reason for that is because there is no settled way to know when the score has been settled. In particular, different parties are likely to disagree about whether a particular act of revenge was sufficient to settle the score, or excessive and itself requiring revenge, or deficient and needing to be shored up with more revenge. So, if A wrongs B, B visits revenge on A to B's, satisfaction, it may be that A thinks that A owes B revenge for that in turn even if B thinks things are now settled, starting the cycle anew. So, it's not just a general worry that cycles of revenge are likely to continue, we know the mechanism by which they are likely to continue, and that mechanism is a disagreement about what counts as the right amount of revenge. You are likely not to be surprised to hear that many early justice systems consist of standards about what is the appropriate amount of revenge for a wrong: the *lex talionis* we find in Babylonian, Biblical, and Roman systems, or the *weregild* system in Germanic societies. But once you're in for a penny, you're in for a pound: these standardised systems work best when they are interpeted and executed in standardised ways (to stop people feeling like the manner in which a standardised punishment was carried out is itself worthy of revenge), and once you have those, you have what is recognisably an institutin of justice much like our own in the important respects.",0,0,0,0,1.0

There can be many different voltages some high, some low, all in the same area in a device. Water you find in the world is full of minerals, which makes the water conduct electricity. This allows the different voltages to mix, which can overload parts of the device which are not able to handle higher voltages.",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"[Star Trek] The Tamarian language can't be translated because it's made entirely of references. How big of a problem is that in other languages?[SEP]I suspect the issue with Tamarian is not how their metaphors were developed but that the metaphors themselves contain a large amount of information. ""Darmok and Jalad"" is an entire story and referencing it requires that the listener know who Darmok and Jalad were, what they were doing on Tanagra, etc. You don't need to know the etymology of ""guy"" to be able to understand it as ""a person"". It's likely not even as simple as saying ""Two people cooperate against a common enemy and leave as friends"" since it is possible that there are many such stories. At the end of the encounter, we see that ""Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel"" has become a new but different story of mutual cooperation against a common enemy that could be translated in the same way but is clearly distinct. It may even be that ""Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra"" could have multiple meanings, with each use specific to one aspect of the story relevant to the current context. So I think the big challenge is that the language is just plain difficult to translate. The Tamarians think about things very differently than most humanoids and can convey a large amount of information in just a few words. A Universal Translator-style translation of a normal conversation might be equivalent to producing entire lecture series on Tamarian mythology and history. The UT might be able to condense things into something more practical but would lose a large amount of nuance and meaning in the process. In DS9, we see a tiny example of this when the augments are watching a Dominion treaty negotiation and are able to pick up on details from the original Dominionese that the translator could not sufficiently convey. Anything translated from Tamarian would be an extreme version of this.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I walked around, turned back to say something to him, and witnessed him attempt to hop over the gate. His foot caught the bar, and he biffed h a r d. Something about the look of the surprise on his face and the way his limbs flailed triggered this gutteral, honking laugh in me that I couldn't stop. I just doubled over, tears streaming down my face, wheezing. This poor guy, expecting compassion from a seemingly sweet girl like me, instead received this horrible ridicule that I felt helpless to stop. Eventually I managed to pant out an apology, but the damage was done. Needless to say, he lost interest in me pretty quickly, and basically didn't talk to me again for the remainder of our 5 years of school together.",0,0,0,0,1.0

He took my cellphone and hid it in the ceiling and receptionist kept calling me and I was going crazy not being able to find it. And then there was a little setback with my boss and situation got escalated and I punched a hole in the wall. Corporate sent me for anger management for 12 weeks but I completed it in just 6 weeks. Second time it was aggregation of events that made me frustrated with situation. I was made manager recently, I went on a love quest for a week to get my receptionist/lover from Florida, an unannounced tour, and a British women, who was recently demoted to my branch, saw my office unoccupied and declared herself as a manager. and CEO, who was hitting on her, did nothing about the situation. Rather he made my temporary problem of erectile dysfunction public. My father thought I was demoted and was disappointed in me.

I got stuck on my own with them at one point, and just to make conversation I asked them if they had any kids. The man of the couple said ""ah, we've been trying but it's not working out"".

Heat increases blood flow which promotes the ability of the body to heal. This is more useful for muscular pain such as those muscles in your pelvic area. This is more suitable for pain that is not caused by muscle tears or recent injury. Conversely, Ice slows blood flow and is best to remove inflammation and slow the process. This is why you use ice on a sprained ankle so it helps reduce swelling. Technically ice could help reduce the swelling effects but it isn’t pleasant long term! You should also consider the psychological effects of having something warm and comforting against you when you are in pain compared to something icy and cold.

All that for a decoration that's about a foot or two tall. Somebody else mentioned Funko pops which I have a few of. A tenner for a small, easily storable, fairly sturdy decorative statue based on some character you like. It's not particularly expensive and certainly won't break the bank. They're appealing for the same reasons posters appeal to people except pops are more convenient since you don't have to hang them up or have each one take up a big chunk of your wall.

Why drink something I have to work to get clean when I can pop a top and drink. I was also huge because of all that. The house we moved to after that out in the country is amazing. It is only slightly sweet? but in a good way. Thats the only way I can describe it. Smooth on the flavor pallette. Lots of natural ground filters around our well. I drink water so much more than I used to. And feel so much better for it. Everywhere I go water has a slightly different flavor. Most bottled waters taste the same though. Those are much more bland.

After seeing my mother we had a pretty weird conversation and we roamed around together for a bit and came back home. If I talk about day to day stuff, then I usually call my boyfriend and rant to him. If talking takes up more energy, I text him about it.

4.0,"How do I make the best of my Master's journey?[SEP]There’s so much to know! I’m finishing my Masters now and start at a top PhD program this Fall. Here’s my advice: 1. Treat it like a 9-5 from day one. If you don’t have ‘that much work to do’ then fill your days with a) reading journal articles on topics that interest you b) beginning to draft papers c) learning programs like SPSS and R that you will need in the future anyways. 2. Come up with a timeline and agree on it with your supervisor. This should include a) when your thesis proposal will be ready b) ethics c) data collection d) first draft of your thesis. Structure it around any goals or deadlines that will help you build your CV such as a conference paper or poster. 3. When you have courses, always do your papers on topics that relate to your thesis or other research interests. You’ll be able to reuse a lot this way. 4. To make yourself a strong PhD application you need demonstrated research experience. Conferences and publications help. Conferences are much, much easier to get under your belt than publications. Present your work any time you have the chance; you’re at the level where even small, local conferences look great on your CV. 5. If you need test scores to be admitted to programs for PhD start studying now. Speaking as someone from a related field (Masters in Organizational Behaviour) being in graduate school builds your reading comprehension and verbal skills massively but your math skills will falter because data analysis and statistics is nothing like the math on the GRE or GMAT. You’ll lose your math quicker than you think so keep those up if you need to take those exams. 6. Having friends outside of graduate school is as essential as having friends inside graduate school. Grad school can be lonely; you need people who understand your experience but you also need people on the outside who can be happy for you without being in competition with you for any of the same awards or scholarships. 7. Talk to your supervisors and research office about scholarships and awards right now. Put the requirements and dates in your calendar. These also look great on PhD applications. 8. Focus on your thesis. It’s ok to take on some research assistant work and side projects but never at the expense of your thesis. You wouldn’t believe how many people do not finish in 2 years because they’re so caught up in other research or projects that their supervisor asked them to help with. 9. Use referencing software from day 1. Zotero or Mendeley - doesn’t matter, just use one. 10. Make friends with the research librarians. Go to them for help. They’re a wealth of knowledge and will save you so much time. Good luck!",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"ELI5 The difference between genetically and biologically of the human body?[SEP]Sex as a biological category is complicated. In humans, cells typically contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, 23 inherited from your dad and 23 inherited from your mother. The first 22 pairs are what we call autosomes, and where the chromosomes in an individual pair are practically identical. The last pair of chromosomes is what we refer to as sex chromosomes. There are two types of sex chromosomes in humans, namely the X-chromosome and the Y-chromosome. Our gametes (sperm and eggs) are haploid, meaning they only have 23 chromosomes. Gametes have to be haploid because they fuse with the gamete of another person during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by germs cells located in the gonads, namely the testicles and the ovaries. Germ cells are diploid and to create a haploid gamete they have to go through a process of cell replication and division called Meiosis. During meiosis, a process called crossing over occurs, where genetic material (genes) are swapped between chromosomal pairs in the cell. This is one of the processes that ensure genetic diversity in humans. What can occur here is that the SRY-gene found on the y-chromosome can be transferred over to an x-chromosome, resulting in a person with two X-chromosomes having the SRY-gene. The SRY-gene is responsible for the activation of male sexual differentiation during early pregnancy. This means that you can be genetically female, while having a functioning SRY-gene, resulting in the development of a male reproductive system. There are also many other factors that play into sex differentiation in humans including the external environment, epigenetics, and so on.",0,0,0,1.0,0

What's different and why?[SEP]Discord is fairly cheap, allows for extra privacy in the fact that students don't have to show themselves on camera if they don't want, and because it is an established brand it is easier to get kids to adopt the use. Classroom is free, but requires extra signup processes and kids would have to download and sign in specially. Zoom has a free tier, but a school trying to host multiple classes over the course of a day with hundreds of students will exceed that limit and require a paid license. On top of the ease of adoption and the price concerns, there is just a lot that can be done on Discord. Students can be allowed in or out of classrooms based on their curriculum, can be given roles like teacher's assistant or tutor to allow them to help others, can quickly go into private messaging to allow for private or embarrassing questions and even use the Discord API to set up different activities, like science experiments.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Also a baby was born live on screen in this movie! Nothing like this will ever be made again. A++++. *Legend* with Tom Cruise is a total mess, an excuse to indulge in a gorgeous-looking fantastical landscape and dreamy synth soundtrack. Huge plus for Tim Curry acting the shit out of his villain role while handfuls of glitter are flung into his face from offscreen. Rating: A+++. *Excalibur* is easily the least entertaining out of the three. You know a movie is doomed when half the cast is made up of the director's children. Anyway, this ponderous Arthurian saga has just enough bizarre elements to make it worthwhile -- why is Lancelot naked? Why is Arthur's mom doing a weird pussy popping dance?

Out of state tuition is often 3 times the cost, absolutely no reason to pay that, you get the same degree. you don't spend decades paying off student loans the size of a rent payment if you have another option. DO NOT worry where your friends go. Very few stay friends with their high school friends even once you go off to college. Kids have gone across the country to be with friends only to have the friend say a month later they want to find a new crowd. people change so much not many friendships and relationships continue, this is not a reason to put yourself thousands more in debt. Do not throw money away on a school you don't need to, especially if you can't go all 4 years. Imagine not being able to take family on vacation or buy a house in a decade because you wanted to go to an out of state school. That is the reality for many 30 year olds, the payment for student loans is just too high to save for a house or kids. ""I just wanna get outta here"" leaevs many kids screwed for years. Do not leave a safe environment where you can save money. Over half of people under age 30 are living with mom and dad due to high cost of living.

I was daydreaming about an Edgar Allen Poe story (as usual) and did not hear my teacher explain that I was supposed to *keep* the book. When it came time to leave, I left without my book. The next day I realized my mistake. But every book on the shelf was gone. So I just left again without one. They thought I was being belligerent by not doing my homework. But I really just didn't have a book, so I couldn't access the assignments, and I was petrified to admit my mistake. I was so socially awkward, and used to being bullied, that I never asked for help--even though my teacher seemed kind. I flunked the class. They put me in remedial classes. And that f\*cked me up in the head enough to not care anymore. So I sat in those classes and daydreamed, too.

The reason I rarely recommend it is because the style in which it is made is quite special. It's almost like a theater play in the sense that its entire story takes place in only one room with only a couple of characters. There aren't any backflashes or temporal ellipses or stuff like that. The narrative time is (almost) equal to the narrated time, as we say in literary studies. In other words, you watch a 2-hour movie and in the movie, you see a story unfold that begins on a late afternoon and ends some time in the evening of that same day. The movie is heavily based on dialogue and interaction. When you describe the movie to people who've never heard of it, chances are high they'll dismiss it and think inside: ""ugh, sounds super boring"". In reality, it's an amazing movie but it's the type of film that you have to see for yourself to understand its charm. Almost all of the people who have watched it feel enlightened and amazed by it.

Contrary to popular belief you aren't actually remade from different particles after being transported, your particles are disassembled and than transported to the desired location through complex quantum mechanics. You are then reassembled or in emergencies stored in a puffer. So it's less a *ship of theseus* situation and more of a *reassembling of IKEA furniture* situation. Nobody would say that the shelf is a different shelf now, just because some assembly was acquired right? It was also reported that someone, who ironically had a transporter phobia aswell, remained conscious during the transport process.

5.0,"eli5 How does destructive interference work?[SEP]The question of *why* waves cancel each other out comes down to something called the superposition principle. This says that the combined action of two processes is the sum of the two individual processes. For example, if I am in a boat, sailing East, but the current flows North, my boat will move Northeast. This direction is a sum of the two forces pushing the boat. The same thing happens with waves. The way waves combine is to simply add the amplitude of the wave at every point. [The Wikipedia article for the superposition principle has more info, including a section on wave interference. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle) This is beyond ELI5, but there is no fundamental reason why the superposition principle should hold for all systems. It is only a linear response. In practice, it is an extremely good approximation for most systems, but it does not always hold.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"ELI5: What does the binary of a computer actually look like, and how does it understand those instructions?[SEP]The computer's brain thinks using two things: actions and items. This is its language. Items are things. Actions do things with items. They can modify items or they can use items to create new items. These items and actions are very small. The objects might just be a single letter or number. The actions will be something simple like: add or copy. The real trick is that we can represent all things with numbers. For example the value for the letter 'A' might be written as 01000001. However this could just as easily be the number representing the number 65 because 64 + 1 = 65. The computer's brain doesn't know or care about the difference. The actions are a lot like objects. They are also numbers. However the computer brain knows to treat them differently. Now, if we combine actions and objects we get instructions. An instruction is one action plus at least one object. Suppose we have two actions: COPY = 0000 0001 ADD = 0000 0002 Suppose we have a few objects: A = 0100 0001 B = 0100 0010 5 = 0000 0101 7 = 0000 0111 We could tell the computer things like: ADD 5 7 (0000 0001 . 0000 0101 . 0000 0111) We can even do ADD B 7 The brain can't tell the difference. The meaning of the objects above don't exist in the cpu. The numbers are just numbers. So, at the hardware level, objects and actions get loaded into the CPU as instructions. The action number gets put in a certain spot and the object numbers get put in certain spots. The cpu then activates. The wires connecting all three parts are designed in such a way that when the electricity has flowed through them, another object is created in a special place. Sometimes this makes a new object in an object spot, other times it just gets stored over an existing object. Then, the cpu deactivates and it loads the next action and objects. One of these objects even may be the result object of the last instruction. A computer's brain is doing this loop over and over again. Binary is used because it makes the wiring logic about as simple as it can practically be. (It's a lot simpler to manage whether electrical signals are low/high rather than low/middle/high) I highly recommend the book ""But how do it know?"". It has a silly title but it's by far the most approachable guide to how a cpu works that I've ever read. It's short and you don't need a math or CS education.",0,0,0,0,1.0

The lady lost it, started going off on this long winded karen type rant about how she was an English teacher back in New Jersey, and how they teach kids better there and don't interject fake words like 'yonder' into the language. She basically was going on about how uneducated and ignorant southerners were, when I just told her ""But soft, what light through yonder window breaks, tis the east and Juliet is the sun."" She asked me to repeat it, and I did, adding ""Yonder is an old english word, something that an english teacher most likely would know. It refers to a direction where the speaker does not know the cardinal direction, and the distance referenced is typically less than a mile.

My parents split up when I was 4 and got back together again and had my little sister just after that because my father promised he'll be more responsible ect... they kept ""trying"" until eventually they divorced 11 years after they had my little sister which whom I was very close. That was a long time ago but now both of them remarried and my mom is living in the other side of the globe with my sister while I'm still living with my father and my ""6yo older than me"" step-mom who is very stupid. living with her and my dad who's clearly can't handle relationships properly is a continuous joke tho. But there's more they also had a baby to tighten the relationship (my father feared she'd leave if he won't have a kid with her). So from the POV of someone who grew up attending all of this. DON'T have a kid to save your relationship. Your relationship is formed by two different people who should communicate and resolve their problems and no number of babies will fix it up.",0,0,0,0,1.0

For all you know theyll get their heart broken again moving on so fast. You dont need to force yourself to go out more or see other people until youre ready.

In such cases i always let the character lead me. Whether it's a happy, tragic or open ending, the more important thing is that the end must completely a cycle for each character. Readers are waiting to see whether each character arc has fulfilled their purpose in the story. It also has to be symbolic to where they began. Depending on characters they also much have come a ways from where they began. Personal development. If you're writing a negetive arc for a character then hitting all the stages of descent into the dark side is important. I do agree that in these uncertain times a happy ending would be good for readers. But I'd say for me personally as long as the character arc can unlock all of it's potential, as long as readers get to see that. Any ending is good.",0,0,0,1.0,0

(now that I recall, I was truly naive and an idiot) but for the time, she would give signs of affection like hugs, hand holding, cuddles etc... I would ask her out but she would end up laughing in my face and said she had no feelings towards me. I felt like shit after that. She would eventually start ghosting me until we split when we entered college. To this day, I still think about her. Guess, a part of me still loves her but I know now it would have never worked even if she agreed. Our ideologies were vastly different and she seemed to be cold at times. In a way, this experience opened up a realization that some people are just plain assholes and I should have realized that instead of falling head over heels. She's done other stuff that I won't mention but she would constantly punch me or slap me or rack me in the balls. At the time I thought of it as a joke but now I realized she was just bullying me.

5.0,"What’s it like being in a poly relationship? How do the dynamics differ from a monogamous relationship?[SEP]It depends a lot on the structure of the relationship. There's no single style of poly - you could have a closed group, or a small web, or a chain that stretches a dozen+ people. I've not been in a ""closed group"" (small group - 3-4 - that is all in a relationship with each other) or a ""v"" (one person who's dating two other people but those people are monogamous with the shared partner); I've been in a polycule while dating two other people, both of whom had other relationships (some of whom had other relationships as well). In that situation, it's all about time management. Sometimes someone will have plans and then something comes up and it throws the plans out of whack. But usually it's all just scheduling and such; with one partner I generally went out with her on Wednesdays, and she had other plans on certain days as well. Really, though, there wasn't much difference than just having a monogamous romantic relationship, but also having different friends you hang out with on different days. In fact, when I was in that situation, it somewhat amounted to that, as I had met those two individuals through different friend groups and we went to those mutual interest events together. That's not to say another relationship can't have other dynamics or elements thereof; there's no one way to do poly right (though there are ways to do it wrong). But it's also difficult to really generalize beyond that for that reason. I also know closed triads who more or less do things as a group together.",0,0,0,0,1.0

I know it's a classic excuse for anyone who gets caught talking in class ""But miss, we were talking about THE WORK!"", but in this particular case I genuinely was. When the class ended and lunch time rolled around, the teacher suddenly remembered she couldn't stay with us for our detention because she had a meeting. So she sent me (and the guy I was sitting next to) to another building where we'd serve our detention by watching some kind of debating competition which was happening over lunch break, and she told us she'd come dismiss us at the second half of lunch, which should have been 20 minutes in. So we're sitting there watching this debate and the half lunch time bell goes. No sign of our teacher. Another 5 minutes pass. 10. 15. We're now 5 minutes from the end of lunch, she still hasn't showed up and we still haven't eaten, all because I dared talk to the guy sitting next to me about our lesson's worksheet. Finally, with 5 minutes of lunch to spare, the English head teacher (who was running this debating comp) stood up and said ""Anyone who is here for a detention may now leave"". Apparently we weren't the only ones - a bunch of students from other classes got up and left. So we breathed a sign of relief, walked out and tried to relish the remaining 5 minutes of lunch we had left. So we're sitting outside trying to shove down our lunch as quickly as possible before the bell goes, and what do we see? Our teacher walking up to collect us, with only 2 minutes of lunch to spare. We both looked at each other like ""you've got to be kidding"". The kicker? When she got there and found that we weren't still watching the debate, she decided (despite my attempts to explain what happened later) that we must never have gone at all, so she escalated our punishment to an after school detention. Did I go? Hellll no. My mum actually wrote a letter to her explaining what happened, but she was having none of it. She tried to claim that she spoke to the head teacher and that he had actually dismissed those who *weren't* on detention... but how does that even make sense? Why would those who were there voluntarily, and could leave at any time, even need to be dismissed in the first place?

Is this weird or rational thinking?[SEP]I don’t think “weird” or “rational” matter very much here. The question is whether this thinking is *helpful* or *productive.* Okay, so it bothers you. Does that mean you want to only date men who are physically larger than you? Does that mean you want to get over it? You feel this way because our society crams our brains full of all sorts of ridiculous ideas about women’s bodies. You’ve been socialized to equate your value as a human being with your physical aesthetics, and to associate “beauty” and “femininity” with physical daintiness and smallness, especially vis-a-vis male bodies. These are constructs; they have little to do with what actual people actually value in one another, and with what actual people actually find attractive in one another. But socialization is very powerful, and knowing these are just societal norms you’ve been brainwashed into doesn’t mean it’s easy to let them go. So, you decide what you want to do. If it bothers you so much you can’t enjoy this relationship, you can end it and look for someone larger, you can devote your precious time and energy to trying to make your own body smaller, or you can do some work on yourself to un-learn these harmful ways of thinking about female bodies.",0,0,0,0,1.0

3.0,"“A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.” has this ever happened to you? If so, how?[SEP]This may not be exactly what you’re looking for, but this concept is important in sports psychology. You do exactly the thing you’re trying not to do all the time, because the subconscious mind (which is in charge of coordinating your movements) doesn’t understand negative instructions. “Just don’t overshoot it”, or “just don’t slice this drive,” or “just don’t kick it straight at the goalkeeper” are not thoughts the mind can turn into actions. When you think “don’t kick it to the goalkeeper” your subconscious doesn’t know what to do with that, but it does respond to the fact that you’re focusing on and visualizing kicking it to the goalkeeper. So lo and behold, that’s exactly what you do. The only productive thoughts are positive instructions; you have to think about what you want to do, never about what not to do. Visualize your penalty kick going into a specific corner of the goal, or your golf swing arcing inside-to-outside to draw instead of slicing, or visualize the cue ball rolling at the desired speed into the position zone.

They needed someone to cover while another employee had surgery. I said I was interested and had the interview the next day (Tuesday.) I arrive at the company and check in with security. The hiring manager meets me there and escorts me up to a break area for the interview. I introduced myself and shook his hand. He proceeded to talk about the job for 15 minutes without asking me a single question. A co-worker comes in and adds a few details to the job, then abruptly asks, ""do you drink?"" I was at a loss, how do I answer this question - especially in light of it being the first question I am being asked! I stammered for a bit, then the co-worker says with a shit-eating grin on his face, ""Don't worry, you will!"" The hiring manager then outright asks me when I could start, and oh yeah, do I have any questions. I inquired about the pay and hours and said I would be able to start immediately.

The laboratory was in the basement. The experiments required me to sit for a long time in the basement, which was damp, dusty, dark, and subject to the continuous noise of running vacuum pumps that pretty much drowned everything else. I had to be there simply to occasionally move a knob or push a button, while trying to study or work the rest of the time, amidst the noise. One day I said, fuck that. I checked the manual of the instrument I was controlling. There was documentation for a digital interface. You had to code the instructions manually after establishing the connection, but it was possible. I found a cable to interface the local computer with the instruments I needed to control. I wrote a program that would connect to the instrument and send the required instructions at the click of a button. Then I used remote desktop functionality to access that computer from my laptop, while sitting in my office. And from then on all I had to do was go in the lab at the beginning of the day, turn the machines on, then turn them off at the end. The rest of the time I'd just monitor and control everything that was happening from my desk, three floors above, while doing something else at my laptop, in perfect, blissful silence.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5: What is our brain doing when ""Something random just occurred to me""?[SEP]Yes, the brain is constantly doing things our conscious mind has nothing to do with. Consciousness allows us to keep a train of thought and stay focused on a problem, but almost everything else the brain does without conscious interference. In fact, it's been demonstrated that our brains start to act before our consciousness enters into play. Your brain already decided to get this for lunch or make that for dinner before you were consciously aware of making the decision. When ""something random just occurred to you"" your brain put together information in the background of your mind and decided ""hey, you should think about this"" and presented it to your conscious mind. It's like how you might be distracted driving but your attention snaps back to the road when something iffy happens cause your peripheral senses, while you were distracted, were still paying attention and got your conscious attention as soon as the information they processed meant something was wrong. Another example is how people with certain types of blindness are able to walk around objects naturally if they're distracted. Their eyes and brain are still communicating and processing the objects around them, but the brain can't present it to the conscious part so they technically can't ""see.""",0,0,0,1.0,0

If you see it as a possible confrontational issue with someone (maybe it already was before) then just try to ponder what the worse outcome could be if it happens.

5.0,"ELI5: Why is it hard to swallow 2-4 times continously?[SEP]I answered this question quite some time ago on this sub. I'll copy paste my comment from then: Here is an excerpt from a paper: Materials in the mouth (food or saliva) and the cortical drive to the tongue and the submental muscles are necessary for initiation of VS. VS stands for voluntary swallow (as opposed to SS, the spontaneous one). I'd have to dig a little deeper to find you a mechanism. But it seems having something to swallow is necessary in addition to the cortical drive (your brain sending the order to initiate the sequential muscle contractions involved). And when you swallow once, you clear some of the saliva, conceivably dipping below the threshold required for the next swallow. This suggests the maximum rate of voluntary swallows depends on the rate of salivary secretion (and that depends on things beyond your control like what else is or has been in your mouth in terms of food and drink and also many other things like your autonomic activation with the sympathetic (fight or flight) or parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous systems). However you will notice that if you try hard enough, you can induce a swallow anyway even if you just had one a few seconds back, but you'll also notice you're flexing some other muscles in your neck that actually stimulate salivary secretion, but this still poses a limit of the maximum swallowing frequency, because you can only force secretion so often in a minute.

Our word planet actually comes from greek, meaning wanderer, because planets look like stars that change positions. The other two planets, Uranus and Neptune, were discovered by optical telescopes. There a lot of math you can do to figure out where these planets are by observing gravitational effects, but it really boils down to just watching the sky through a telescope. Astronomy is mostly just picking out a section of sky and recording everything you see for days on end.

4.0,"ELI5: Why does voltage not effect battery charge time?[SEP]The voltage is relevant because that is what determines the current. Let's look at Li-ion batteries. When they discharge an ion is moving from the cathode through the electrolyte to the anode. A li-ion is positive changes and an election will move from the cathode to the anode outside the battery so you do not get a net charge on either. There will be one election per lithium-ion. A current=charge/ time so the current is the number of electrons that move in the conductor. To recharge a battery you need to do the same in reverse and one election needs to move per lithium-ion. So to move back all lithium a fixed amount of charge need to go from the anode to the chatode. So the current= charge/time equation will be valid But let now look at what determines the current. A battery can be molded as a voltage source in series with the internal resistance of the battery. Not a perfect model but accurate enough for this post Ohms law applies so V=I\*R or I=V/R The voltage over the internal resistance is the difference in voltage you charge it with and the voltage of the battery if the circuit is open. So the current is ((Voltage over battery)-(battery open circuit voltage))/ (battery internal resistance). If you increase the voltage the current will increase. But all energy will not be used to change the battery, a lot of it will be heated from the internal resistance. When you change a lion battery you first change with a constant current and that is done by changing the voltage over the battery so you get the correct current. When it is at 80% you change to a constant voltage charging. You set the voltage to the final voltage you like to charge to. The current will now drop over time. Because battery internal voltage is not something you know exactly and it will change over time it simpler just to look at the current. &amp;#x200B; So charge time do depend on voltage because the current you have will depend on the voltage.",0,0,0,1.0,0

If those people had never read your writing I would say that they had a statistical likelihood of being right. However, you’re right in the sentiment that it isn’t helpful. There are probably plenty of people who could potentially have had the skill to be professional writers but never tried, or waited until they were much older because the elders/authority figures in their lives discouraged them. I don’t think people look down on writing as a job. If you can manage to make a living off writing, it’s impressive. But it is rare, because there are a lot of talented hopefuls compared to the number of jobs, so saying you want to be a writer is often associated with naïveté.

A decent quality wired headphones will be significantly cheaper than wireless ones of the same quality.

I message him throughout the day whilst im working. Just small things like ""Yay now im getting breakfast!"". It helps me feel closer to him, and he enjoys the read. He does the same for me just less when im the one working or out for the day. Investing in a bond touch might also help with a ""im thinking of you!"" throughout the day. We've been long distance for two years now, we're working on immigrating me to the US with him which will take about another year and a half. It definitely isnt easy, and sometimes it will stagnate.

When a building is taken down or rebuilt it was often necessary to bring up up to street-level; maybe you will fill in the old foundation hole with some more dirt or gravel or you just build on top of the old foundations. Nowadays its a little different because we can use enormous machines to dig foundations very deeply or just use a thin layer of asphalt when the street needs fixing but the same thing happens. Sometimes nature covers it up. Floods can deposit a lot of dirt and rubble. Earthquakes, slips. Wind can blow a lot of dirt and sand around.

(If she moves diagonally first she can only move file for the second move, conversely she can only move diagonally on the second love if she moves file for the first move. This means she can move in ""V"" or ""\_""shaped patterns.) She cannot move a second time if she takes a piece with the first move. Rooks: Rooks now crash into enemies with additional velocity, allowing them to hit enemies directly behind the target in the same direction. However, you cannot move the same rook two turns in a row making them vulnerable after attacking. King: Kings can now learn to fight, every time the king takes a piece his range increases by 1. Pawns: Pawns are now escape artists and can break free from the enemy prison with a bit of help. If a knight makes it to the 8th rank you can take back 1 of your missing pawns and place it anywhere in the 2nd rank.

5.0,"ELI5: How does furniture polish work?[SEP]Wood is naturally porous - like a sponge. Wood is sometimes treated with oil, but typically it's vanished. Wood is basically coated in something to make it shiny. This coating can be too many things: * The excretions of lac beetles is very traditional (shellac, lacquer) - this is also used on many candies to make it shiny. * Nitrocellulose was popular in the early 1900s * Urethane or acrylic plastic is common today * Linseed oil is sometimes used * Natural waxes like beeswax, or synthetic wax from crude oil can also be used * Natural resins like amber, copal, and mastic can be used * Epoxy resins are used for extra durability The actual polish typically contains an oil or wax - when you rub this on it leaves a residue that makes it shiny. Some polishes can contain acids (vinegar, lemon, or synthetic ones), or solvents that can dissolve or thin some of the original finishes. Sometimes this can make it shinier, remove scratches, etc - but it can also weaken and degrade the finish. I would typically recommend a wax - like a paste finishing wax. These don't remove or damage the old finish, you're just adding something on top to make it shiny. If it's in bad shape - gel paint stripper to remove the old finish and a can or spray bottle of polyurethane will give it a good maintenance free finish that will last for many years.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Since it is not the same for everyone. Then try to do those things, heck even put them in your agenda if it's helps (but try to avoid the pattern).

Think of anything that you use every day and keep all of that separate so you aren’t sifting through boxes to find a toothbrush, charger or favorite item of clothing.

Every time I’ve moved I’ve spent exorbitant amounts of money on take out because I was too busy to get groceries, but every single time I wish I had.

4.0,"Tips for overcoming baldness insecurity?[SEP]30 year old baldy beardy gym goer here 👋🏼 I used to have the exact same confidence issue. Grew my hair long when I noticed it was going and was effectively a comb over for a while. I've had my hair short for about 8 years and been doing a number 0 with a trimmer for the last 4 or 5 and I'm blonde with fine hair so it looks like a clean shave. Also I'm doing an apprenticeship so I too work with some younger folk who all have full heads of hair. One of them was even amazed by me as she'd never spoken to a bald person before 😂 It's a big knock to your confidence I agree and it can take a while to overcome the embarrassment, but my advice is to just own it. Take the mick out of your lack of locks sometimes, be the first to crack that bald joke, tell people it makes you look like Jason Statham, The Rock, Bruce Willis. Try telling yourself how easy it is having no hair. No trips to the barbers, no sorting out your hair in the morning, wash your whole head with face wash, no dandruff (and if you do get dandruff, just moisturise that dome) no worrying if your hair looks alright and also, it makes you look like a geezer. It's pretty blokey having no hair. Hench bald guy with a beard = lady killer. I've seen studies, will try to find them for reference if I can, that have said how baldness is an attractive trait to a lot of women as it gives off signs of high testosterone, especially if you feel and look like you own it. Even if you're not owning it, act like you do and then after time you will. Young'ns always have questions about being bad that they will ask, just answer in confidence, act like you don't care and you'll own it. Being bald is great 🥚 Edit: I should also say, nearly everybody actually doesn't care if you're bald. Kids might say stuff but fuckem, they're kids.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I’m currently living in Denmark though and think it’s amazing, Denmark is pretty much the same except they’re a little more laid back which is pretty much my biggest issue with Swedes.

It's litter surface is covered in part by large hexagonal scales that are separate but when the creature curls up they lock together providing armoured protection from predators and hunters. Their scales are similar to a chameleons skin in that they can adapt to their surrounding environment except that their scales augment their surface texture in addition to colour to blend in with wherever it is they find themselves. At night they will find a high branch to rest on and their scales will allow them to blend in so that arial predators wouldn't notice even if they were to accidentally land on them, and the trees foliage and their height from the ground protect them from anything that can't climb. Their faces are akin to a foxes with a long snout and their teeth are short but very sharp and fine to help them clip away their preferred meals quickly to minimise exposure.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Women's fashion in the modern world is a lot of super tight pants, dresses, etc. And lots of dresses, especially in the summer, are thin fabrics that really hug the body. This became even more prevalent with the leggings fashion that blew up in the last 2-3 decades. Leggings are very form fitting and will show the panties very obviously. So if you wear full size panties, it will show the panties crease and outline on the butt. Women don't like that. But if you were a thong, it doesn't show that, you just see a smooth butt contour. Beyond that, thongs are just hot. They cover very little, show off pretty much as much as possible. Women like to wear hot fashion.

Even if (like in most cases) it’s not genetics, your kids will mimic you and your behavior, including your eating and exercise habits. My dad has been roughly 200 pounds for over 40 years, since he was 13. It’s changed from fat to pure muscle and everywhere in between, but I’ve taken after him. Just without the muscle part. When he was younger and did sheet metal and roofing 10-12 hours a day 6 days a week he was shredded. When he was in middle school, he was obese. He would fatten up during school season and over the summer he’d gain more muscle as he worked every day. But his eating habits never really changed, he’s addicted to Mountain Dew and has always weighed about 200 pounds. He’s passed that on to me and my brother. But we don’t do nearly as much manual labor (thanks to him working his balls off for 30+ years to get into a position where we own a successful business) so we just stay... in shape (round is some sort of shape, right?)

But it disrupted my professional development there. Half of the office began working from home, but my position couldn’t allow it. During the initial lockdown, I was moved to work alone in the conference room. It was awful. Because the office was so small, I feel like for a good time I wasn’t being taught into work things over time. And with there being fewer orders, I began often running out of things to do. As a result, I started being more attentive to things that bothered me of other coworkers than my actual job and began going crazy overtime. I resigned in March because I had enough. So while that job drove me crazy throughout 2020, it kept me steady financially and I had a great amount in savings for me to have no issues leaving. Since I’ve resigned, I’ve felt great.

4.0,"Why do anarchists object to representative democracy?[SEP]Anarchism is typically defined as a political philosophy that opposes illegitimate and coercive hierarchies, and representative democracy very frequently (if not exclusively) falls under that camp of a problematic hierarchy, especially in today's world. Anarchist and more broadly leftist and Marxist analysis of societies that are described as representative democracies today rejects the view that these societies are genuine democracies. It is argued that these societies are under the domination of a capitalist class which through lobbying and other mechanisms ensures that the will of the majority is never represented by the alleged representation (such as through parliamentarians, congressmembers, presidents, etc). Marxists typically describe the state as an organ of class rule, but anarchists would go as far as to say that the existence of a state in any time period or form is symptomatic of a coercive hierarchy where one group of people have more power than another. Some anarchists might argue that a society could however democratically consent to a genuine representation, such as the election of an ambassador to represent an anarchist society in matters of international diplomacy. They could argue that such representation is not coercive and does not represent the kind of illegitimate hierarchy that should be opposed, especially if the ambassador does not wield any actual power over society. On the other hand, even if there were no corrupting influences and no capitalist class anarchists are typically still skeptical of vertical power structures and believe flat and horizontal associations in society are more morally justified or produce better outcomes. There is debate within anarchism about what constitutes an illegitimate hierarchy. Virtually all anarchists would agree however that societies that are typically defined as ""representative democracies"" today are thoroughly illegitimate.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I also had one that was similar, only they never complimented you on anything and they were not too polite about their approach. Assertive doesn't inherently mean rude. It just means they don't stand idle and watch things play out when there is something they could do, and that they try to fix problems where they see them because that makes things work better than just trying to make people feel better about problems.

5.0,"ELI5: Why are we able te remember that we are forgetting something and not what?[SEP]Recognizing there's a hole is different than knowing what was in the hole.

This is, among other things, why people can clearly ""remember"" events that you can conclusively prove didn't happen the way they remember. When we ""remember that we're forgetting"", we're recognizing a hole. ""Something is supposed to be here but I don't know what it is."" That is totally different than ""What goes in this hole?"".

Organic molecules generally undergo similar reactions to one another, often distinct from the reactions undergone by inorganic molecules. This is why the study of high level chemistry is split into organic and inorganic chemistry. Edit: Apparently organic molecules do not need to contain hydrogen.

One of them was able to escape, i believe hid behind the washing machine and found his moment. The other sibling was running down the road was chased down into a wooded area. The stories that were going around were absolutely fucking horrific. My friends and I never really knew anything of the family, but one of my friends lived somewhat nearby and knew where the house was. One night we decided to walk to the house (which had been abandoned for some time after the incident). This was in the height of our naive interest in Ghost adventures. We walked down that same road and stood behind the house for about a half hour seeing if anything would happen. Just knowing we where at the spot gave me horrible vibes, which is probably half of the experience anyways. We heard some rustling in the woods behind their house (an animal), and my friends tried to hype up the spookiness like something was happening. Regardless, the details of the event and being in the same spot were enough to keep me from wanting to do something similar again.

Now, even with a 2 projector system they could often use 6,000 foot reels and for a moment there they did try switching over (I distinctly recall New Line trying it) but the 6,000 foot reels they shipped on were cheap and ultimately unwieldy to transport as opposed to Goldberg cans. This is just random, but I remember seeing Jurassic Park in DTS and being stunned that they continued a music cue from one reel into the next (it was as they were first touring the island).

He said ""hey, do you remember that time in first grade when (my name) peed her pants? What a loser."" A few minutes later, I asked the teacher for a hall pass to use the bathroom. I went down to the cafeteria and bought myself an apple juice and grabbed one of those little free plastic cups for water. I poured just a little bit of juice in there, and returned to the classroom. I stopped in front of his desk, and said ""hey, do you want a NEW (my name) pee story?"" And I threw the juice in his face. For that glorious first couple of minutes he legit thought it was my pee, and the teacher was furious, but the other students were laughing so hard and I explained the juice and what he said.

The Python slept in bed with him and his girlfriend - for years. Pythons typically “sleep” 16-18 hrs a day, so they don’t move around a lot at night. As the snake grew larger, it displayed interesting behavior at night. While it used to sleep curled or wrapped up, it started to move around and sleep vertically, like us. The owners were worried and went to the vet and explained the odd behavior. The vet asked “where is the snake now? You need to get it out of your apartment - he is sizing you up to see if you can fit in his body”. They were clearly spooked and thank god they went to the vet when they did. They probably had 1-2 weeks before the snake became big enough. To answer OP seriously, I sleep pretty long. Temperpedic is worth the purchase.",0,0,1.0,0,0

5.0,"ELI5 why ports of old games on new consoles (SNES games on Switch for e.g) still have framerate issues?[SEP]Old games are written in the language of the old hardware. So, to port the old game you can (1) Translate each individual game to run on new hardware or (2) Pretend to be the old hardware. Obviously, if you plan on porting more than one game, option 2 is better because it's reusable, and that's what the Switch is doing. So the Switch hardware isn't just running the game, it's also running a software version of the entire SNES itself. The Switch's emulator also adds a rewind feature, which basically means it has to save the entire game state every second. Also, there could be inefficiencies in the design of the SNES itself that have to also be emulated in order to avoid breaking games. There could also be inefficiencies in the code of the game too. Normally, fast enough hardware would make those inefficiencies completely unnoticeable. But a lot of games were written specifically with the original hardware in mind, including the speed. So the emulator actually has to purposely run at the slower, original speed to preserve the intended speed of the game.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: why is partially hydrogenated oil deemed unsafe and banned by the FDA but regular hydrogenated oil is not?[SEP]Firstly its important to understand what saturated and unsaturated fats are. Fats in nature tend to be what we call triglycerides, this is a weird looking chemical, but essentially it consists of a thing called glycerol at the top, consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon with three ""legs"" that consist of just carbon and hydrogen. Google an image of a triglyceride find out what I mean. You notice that this will consist of a carbon backbone with a bunch of hydrogen surrounding this carbon. Now these are pretty good at storing energy, turns out things that have a bunch of carbon and hydrogen in them but little oxygen tend to burn pretty well. Sugars have a higher proportion of oxygen in them which makes them less desirable as energy storage but are still used because they are smaller than lipids and thus easier to break down. Saturation refers to the question of how full these legs are of hydrogen molecules. Fully saturated triglycerides have these legs completely full of hydrogen, to the point where all bonds in the carbon backbone are either single bonds to other carbon atoms or bonds to hydrogen atoms on the sides. The symmetry here tends to make these legs nice and straight, these have very nice properties such as being solid at room temperature because their legs are nice and straight and not bent, they tend to settle into a solid pretty easily (imagine a bunch of toothpicks stacked perpendicularly, that's why butter is solid). Then there are unsaturated fats. They lack two or more hydrogen molecules in their legs, and instead those carbon atoms lacking a hydrogen make a double bond with their neighboring carbon molecule. Usually these double bonds make the leg ""kink"" and bend to one side (google saturated vs unsaturated fats for images). This is why say vegetable oils are liquid, these kinks prevent it from forming a nice dense solid at room temperature and instead keep the oil as a viscous liquid, as the kinks cause the fat molecules to tangle but not arrange nicely and close enough to solidify. Which brings us to the question of what is hydrogenation and why is it done. Fats in vegetables tend to be unsaturated, while fats in animals tend to be saturated. The traditional reason for this is because saturated fats hold more energy and this is useful for animals because this means less weight that they have to carry to get some amount of energy, while plants just don't care how heavy they become, they are grounded anyways and don't have a heating system to melt the saturated fats so that they can go where they are needed. But vegetables tend to be easier to raise than animals, including their fats. People use both saturated and unsaturated fats in cooking for their respective reasons, sometimes its useful to have a solid fat at room temperature. Point is people wanted to turn vegetable oils into a solid product, and for that we have to figure out how to saturate vegetable's unsaturated fats. Some smart people came up with the idea of hydrogenation, the idea is that under immense pressure we can force additional hydrogen atoms into unsaturated fats and saturate them further. What they found is that the process of hydrogenation sometimes makes fats that are known as trans fats. Normal unsaturated fats have this ""kink"" that I mention because in nature most plants make fats that are known as ""cis unsaturated fats"" meaning that the two hydrogens that are missing for unsaturated fat is found on the same side of the leg, which causes the leg to bend in that direction, nature is pretty good at crafting atoms together in a specific way and plants almost always produce cis fats. But trans fats occur when these missing hydrogen spots are found on the opposite sides of the legs, you can think of it that one missing hydrogen kinks the leg and the other kinks it in the other way because its on the opposite side, causing the legs to be straight. For a while this wasn't considered a problem, in fact this was considered good because trans fats, like fully saturated fats, tended to solidify well because the leg of the fat was not kinked, and it was cheaper for manufacturers in terms of the amount of hydrogen they had to put in and the amount of time spent saturating. This leg to them partially hydrogenating the fats rather than fully hydrogenating. And hell it was even better, because saturated fats have more calories in them than unsaturated. They could get the benefits of saturated fat's solidification without its calorie cost. But for whatever reason, trans have a pesky habit of getting stuck in your arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks. Fully saturated fats have this too but for whatever reason trans fats tend to do this even more. So the solution has been to ban partial hydrogenation and move to full hydrogenation, eliminating trans fats.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Do contemporary formalists criticize the merits of Godel's incompleteness theorem? What is the relation of enmity that might exist between the two?[SEP]Both of your questions sound weirdly phrased to me. Gödel's incompleteness theorems aren't up for dispute, they are mathematical theorems. They're neither criticized or something that has a relation of enmity to something, it doesn't engage in any dispute where we figure out if formalism is true or the incompleteness theorem. Do you simply want to know why the incompleteness theorems essentially canceled the formalist programs of Hilbert and Co? Well, the second theorem says that exactly the thing formalists wanted to do was impossible. Hilbert wanted to show that we don't need some 'deeper' commitment to a system of infinitary mathematics like ZFC, but that it can be understood as a formal system that we can prove consistent with the means of finitary mathematics. Finitary mathematics was seen as more secure because its consistency never really was in question. It's very easy to believe that peano arithmetic is consistent, you can look at the natural numbers and see that there is a structure in which all axioms are true at the same time, so they're not inconsistent. And once we proved that ZFC is consistent using those secure tools, we don't really need to worry about anything. But Gödel's second theorem says that the consistency of a system like ZFC can't be proven from a weaker system. So this entire project can't be successful.",0,0,0,0,1.0

The average vagina is only about 3-4 inches deep. This means a penis of average size, around 5 inches, would be more than enough to full the vagina. On top of that ""going deeper"" only feels better for the penis. The g spot is about 1.5 inches in snd going further into the vaginally canal doesn't stimulate the vagina any more. The only thing better about large penises would maybe be that they look nicer? But frankly, the penis is an unattractive appendage regardless of size lol and most women aren't bothered by how a penis looks.

You don’t notice that you’re being hit billions (trillions? more?) times a second because that’s just called air pressure, and it’s been happening since the day you were born. It’d be a problem if they were all moving in one direction though. Anyway, wind is just a slight bias to all those particles moving. When they touch you, they carry off some sweat, which your body dumps heat into before squirting it out to evaporate, carrying that heat with it.

Based on the number of groups, you get various possible shapes. For instance, water has two unbonded electron groups on the oxygen and two bonds on it.

An aerofoil causes air to move faster around it, which creates lift. What this accomplishes is that the boomerang is pushed to the left (most boomerangs I’ve seen are left-rotating) from whatever direction it is parallel to. If you get enough spin that that aerofoil turns through enough air to push it just at the right rate and right amount, you can get it to come right back to you. Otherwise it whizzes past you and you duck anyways. This is my basic understanding. I may be wrong, at parts, but I know for a fact that the boomerang is shaped like a plane’s wing, and instead of getting lift upwards it gets most of the lift normal to the boomerang as torque.",0,0,0,0,1.0

We went camping, it was all quite fun, until it got dark. For dinner we prepared salad and grilled meat, but once we finished, my father and I took care of ordering some things while my sister went to wash the dishes. About 5 minutes passed and my sister came back, trembling and completely pale, and asked me to please accompany her, because she did not feel safe in the sink (I must add that there was a common sink where everyone went to wash dirty things, so it was a bit far from where we were camping. Not too far, but a bit). After telling her not to be so scared, I decided to accompany her because she didn't wanted to go alone. As we approached the sink it was completely dark, so I had to approach with a flashlight. As I got closer I saw that there were spiders on the sink, at that moment I turned to laugh, thinking that it was the spiders that had scared my sister. I approached again and when I was about to crush one of the spiders, a shadow of what seemed about 2 meters passed extremely fast behind the sink, hiding behind (and I say that it was very fast, at a speed impossible for a normal human). Obviously I was scared and I approached with the flashlight to check what that had been, but there was nothing. I turned around to see if my sister had also seen what I had, and I only saw her again pale, trembling and with wide eyes. I looked again in the direction of the sink to now realize that the figure was now about 5 meters from where we were, totally still. It looked like the figure of a normal person, except that it was very tall and was completely dark (although I pointed the flashlight at it). We both looked at each other, saying with our eyes: ""We must get out of here quickly."" Just at that moment the figure began to move towards us, so we instantly ran out of there. We went back to our dad and we told him everything, he got angry with us and went to wash by himself, and when he came back he told us that he did not know what we were talking about, and that he had not seen anything in the sink.

5.0,"How would Marx and other prominent Communist philosophers react to ""people seeking out communism to expand their privilege"" and is luxary inherently against communist goals ?[SEP]Moishe Postone posits in his book Time, Labor, and Social Domination that orthodox Marxists had the trouble of reaffirming the superficial Marxian understanding of labor as a trans-historical category guiding social development. He says that this is mistaken, as the method of Marxism (immanent dialectical critique) expresses categories of social analysis only as far as they are aligned with the current historical period: when we consider that socialism is an expansion and improvement upon capitalist productivity and industrialism by way of social planning, we forget that what Marx was ultimately critiquing is the status of *labor* in capitalist society, which is growing increasingly anachronistic to society as the productivity and processes of social reproduction become defined by things increasingly removed from labor. All of this is to say that post-capitalism should be defined not only by a transformation of the capabilities of production, but also as a wide transformation of work and labor. Labor under socialism (which I use interchangeably with communism) is much more enriching to individuals. So, communism ultimately implies a society more in line with the will of people and their desire unimpeded by the capitalist production process. There isn’t a class of people who “benefit” the most from socialism because socialism has no classes. As for your point against anarchism...anarchism’s anti civilization tendencies are widely discredited and seen as foolish by Marxists...read J.J. Rousseau!",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"What movie does everyone love that you think aged horribly?[SEP]The original _Star Wars_ isn't actually all that elegant of a production, and without the music and special effects it would be very weak as a drama (in fact Alec Guinness, who had starred in many classic films before becoming Obi-Wan, thought it was drivel), and relatively dull as an adventure. _Star Wars_ excelled because no one had ever done a picture like that before. It was viscerally exciting and mind-blowing, but only to people who'd never experienced anything like it. Other movies, shows, and games have since done a better job, and to modern audiences the original _Star Wars_, while undeniably a couple of hours well-spent, wouldn't make the same meteoric impact. That's perhaps a stretch to characterize as ""aged horribly,"" but certainly I think the film has fallen a great ways from its original height.

When they own the float, they are talking about the shares that investors like you or me can buy. This is nothing exciting until you add in the naughty things the hedge funds have been doing. Very simply put, hedge funds have been selling shares that they don’t own. So many in fact that if they were ever ‘forced’ to give these real shares the the people that bought them, they would have to buy 1.7 times or more of the total float (depending on how naughty they have been selling fake shares). So imaging you have 10 bananas, and the hedge funds (HF) only have 3, but own someone else 15 bananas. They will give their 3 away, pay you basically whatever you decide to sell your 10 bananas at, plus they have to rebuy 7 more bananas from the person they owed 20 bananas to, and give them back. And that’s if you even want to sell them. You might like the stock (company), and bot want to sell. Now it’s all much more complicated then that, as the hedge funds were actually shorting the stocks, and strong evidence they have been trading off market to manipulate the prices of the stock.

Bostrom's hypothesis is not that there are myriad intelligent civilizations, but rather that we are part of a civilization whose future includes a state of technological sophistication in which many ancestor simulations are built. &gt; how can we look at the universe in our level of reality that is a simulation, and infer anything about the higher reality?

There may be a problem with this sort of reasoning, but in that case what you ought to do is point out the problem, rather than just dismissing its possibility at face. &gt; Would not the proper argument be: there exists many intelligent civs in our universe - therefore there is likely a simulated lower level reality under ours?

5.0,"What led to British philosophy being centered around ideas of practicality, empiricism and ""common sense"" ideas?[SEP]Is this British philosophy, or is this a particular construction of British philosophy developed in a motivated way by deemphasizing cases that don't fit the view and emphasizing those that do? I mean, if British philosophy is the tradition of common sense empiricism, what do we make of Cambridge Platonism, which represents the clearest and most significant extension of Renaissance Platonism into the early modern period? What do we make of the school around John Norris, which represents the clearest and most significant continuation of Malebranche's program? What do we make of the culture around Coleridge, arguably the most influential Anglophone philosopher of his generation, and function as an Anglicizing gateway for continental ideas about idealism and romanticism? What do we make of British Idealism, arguably the dominant tradition in academic British philosophy for several generations, and a the most robust continuation of a broadly Hegelian program even after Hegel had lost his hold on the continent? Usually, these movements get presented as the losers in a process of historical development: Cambridge Platonism loses to Lockean empiricism, which then stands for us as the true spirit of British philosophy; British Hegelianism loses to Russell and Moore's logical atomism. But it's important to note that when we say things like this, we're not presenting a description of what philosophical ideas were most popular in Britain during most of the time, but rather presenting a motivated history according to which we take it that certain ideas -- though not necessarily most popular for most of the time -- count for us as the *right* ones. On top of this, the resulting construction of a supposedly integrated tradition of British empiricism suppresses what were in their time quite different phenomena. Philosophers like Hume, Butler, and Shaftesbury, now happily recruited as paragons of British empiricism, positioned themselves as critics of Lockean empiricism. Newton, who we're happy in retrospect to reinterpret in, say, Berkeleyan-Humean terms, was himself a rather more ambivalent figure and significantly indebted to, for instance, Cambridge Platonism -- and found, in his time, his most intimate spokesman in Samuel Clarke, an emphatically ""rationalist"" sounding philosopher with massive influence in his time, who is himself now often suppressed in folk histories of British philosophy for not fitting with the desired stereotype.",0,0,0,0,1.0

This changed when we went to school. She wanted to be popular while I became an outcast because of what now I know were symptomes of ADHD. When we were alone we acted like best friends but as soon as someone ""cooler"" joined in she treated me like thrash. She was making fun of the way I looked and behaved, she was making up lies like ""she beated me up"" or ""she stole from me"" after we had minor arguments. She was also isolating me from our mutual friends.. Still, I was really loyal and protective of her. I was also really forgiving because she was the only friend I had (the mutual ones were the grandkids of our neighbours who were visiting our village once every few years). Soon she started hanging out with me only because my cousins are from France, she thought having french friends was cool for some reason. She became obsessed with their country just to impress them, lmao.. We parted our ways after me and my family moved out but was still seeing her every summer. I really thought she grew up but this illusion crashed after she introduced her new best friend to me and my cousins. Around her she was treating me like shit, she made it clear that I'm just a burdain to her and she's tired of spending time with me. Even though I wanted to spend some time with my cousins I left and have seen her only once since then.

5.0,"ELI5: Why does oil not evaporate like water does?[SEP]1. Something boiling/evaporating means its individual particles flying out of the liquid into gas phase. Different things have different boiling points - it's determined by what forces are present within that liquid. If the particles like sticking to each other, it takes higher heat to make them fly apart (aka evaporate). 2. Liquids evaporate when the temperature is above *or close to* their boiling point. Some evaporation happens *below* the boiling point because ""temperature"" is just the *average* speed of particles. Water boils at 100C, but water at 90C has quite a few individual particles moving at 100C-speed, and those are the ones that fly off and evaporate. That's the steam you see! Room temp water evaporates because even at \~20C, there are a few particles that reach 100C-speed and fly off. **TLDR**: Every liquid has an ""escape speed"" needed for particles to fly off and evaporate. The further below the boiling temp it is, the less likely its particles are to reach escape speed. The result of 1&amp;2: * Some things have lower boiling points than water, like acetone (nail polish remover, boils at 56C). They evaporate faster than water does, maybe you've experienced this? It's because acetone molecules (particles) don't like sticking together as much as water does. * Some things have higher boiling points than water. Their particles really like sticking together. Eg olive oil boils at 180C. * Net result: The oils on your face are much farther below their boiling point than water is, so they ""don't"" evaporate. (actually they do but very very slowly, everything does). Bonus: Solids are just things whose molecules like sticking together even more than liquids do. Every material has a melting point escape temp/speed too, and all the logic I said for boiling/evap above applies. **TLDR 2**: Oil doesn't evaporate for the same reason a pile of coins doesn't melt. The temp isn't hot enough to get the material in question to stick to itself less.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Stark's ""Titanium-Gold"" alloy he uses no one knows it's per capita kg price. CNC machine Stark already had. Bear in mind Mark III suit was fabricated in Stark's House at home in less than a day.

5.0,"Morally which of these options is best for bringing up your child?[SEP]If we take psychology concepts like modeling into account, then the pursuit of the former is likely to include the latter. However, the pursuit of the latter might very well be less likely to coincide with the former, and it may even impede itself. Kind of like a self-defying prophecy. If you raise them solely to benefit others, they will likely grow to resent the world as though the world is a parasitic environment that only demands utility out of them. However, if you see them as worth nurturing for their own benefit, then it is probably more likely they will see the world as an environment that is also worth nurturing. Basically, your more personable interactions will get through the message of altruism much more easily then some sort of rule-based altruism, or wholly selfless altruism. Kind of reminds me of Kant’s ideas on treating humans, not as tools, but as ends in and of themselves. Although it’s not the most universal of dictum’s, it definitely seems to ring true here.

Learn to leave some things unsaid for the sake of people's feelings when those things don't matter. Commenting on appearance is a good example.

But I never knew whether these requests were from individuals or from facility leaders. We didn't ask, we just mailed masks to whoever requested batches of them and hoped they would be put to use as much as possible. I sewed a little, but by the end of the group when PPE manufacturers were catching up to demand and home sewists were burning out, I was managing sourcing and shipping materials to people that were sewing faster than I could. I mailed out every piece of cotton quilting fabric in my stash, invented a new faster way to make yarn from tshirts to use as mask ties when elastic was out of stock everywhere, asked my community for shirts and sheets and woven cotton fabrics that could be used as mask material, I worked my butt off and got giant packages of supplies to over 20 sewists and sewing groups. We didn't get much feedback for the masks we sent, only a very sincere thank you once in a while which was great motivation to sew faster lol. I don't blame people for not getting back to us, they're overworked and busy and exhausted. I just always wondered if the majority of the masks we sent were able to be used or not because they weren't technically up to safety and sanitization standards? We had guidelines to use only tighly woven cotton, publicly available mask research was slim back then but that was the best we could do out of the few articles we found, but I have no idea if that means they were able to hold up in an autoclave or not.

4.0,"Why is USB-C much faster than USB1 even though the connector is much smaller?[SEP]The size of the connector has very little to do with the data transfer rate. Electrical signals travel through wires at the speed of light. It is how quickly the signals can be switched that determines the rate of data transfer. The original USB standard was described in the 1990s which is like the Iron Age as far as data communications for commercial purposes are concerned. It was designed to be cheap, reliable and ""fast enough"" for the uses at the time. Remember the internet wasn't even very developed at that time - real time video transmission was barely possible with the computers and networks of that era. Smartphones weren't even invented yet (at least nothing like a modern smartphone) 25 years later, electronics have become much cheaper, computers are faster, the internet is superfast. So the new standard is designed to fit the need of current applications. At the end of the day USB-C and USB 1.0 are simply standards ie a bunch of rules written on paper. These standards are always a compromise between cost and performance so that the manufacturers who adhere to them have something that is broadly useful yet not too expensive.",0,0,0,1.0,0

""Taking advantage"" implies they are being abusive and shuts down the conversation. I think a better way to put it would be ""Is using someone's ignorance to get them to do something always malevolent"". Well, that's basically parenting. You're ordering a human around under the assumption that your experience is better for it because of their ignorance. I'd say that a line is crossed if you have an opportunity to give the human information that would allow them to make their own choice, but instead you withhold some information, and only provide the information that you feel will lead them to make the decision you feel is right. So essentially you're manipulating someone to make a specific choice instead of giving them the tools to make their own choice. I can provide an example. I had someone close to me whose car engine died. They didn't know much about cars and asked me for my help. My mechanic told me they could put in a new engine, but that it was basically the same price as buying a newer car of equal value. I personally, and my mechanic felt that buying a new engine was a waste of money. However, I gave the owner of the car their options. I gave my recommendation, but I didn't tell them that was their only option. They chose to replace the engine. If I had told them they needed a new car, that would have been manipulative and wrong. Also, it may have been the right choice for them. While I'm completely capable of shopping for a new car, they knew so little about cars, they may have gotten ripped off, and were more comfortable knowing a trusted mechanic would fix the car. So the ""right"" decision for you, isn't always the right decision for another person.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5 How does the Monte Carlo method work, and apart from Pi, what can it be used to approximate?[SEP]So I am actually running a monte carlo simulation for a research project right now, here is the reason I would argue its the right tool for certain jobs. (hopefully in layman's terms) In research, we like to have testable hypothesis, so that we can give some estimate of whether our results are simply due to random chance, or whether we truly have a real result. The simplest way to do this is by running a linear regression. Without getting into what that actually entails, it is sinple enough to say that linear regression relies on a few assumptions. One of those assumptions is that we know what the distribution of our outcome is. For example, we know that a truely random coin should have a 50% chance of heads and a 50% chance of tails. Because we know this information, we can exactly determine how likely it was that we saw ""H H H H"" on 4 flips. We can then use that information to make the statement, The chance of getting 4 Hs in a row was ~6.25%. However, when we do not exactly know the distribution, we have to make assumptions about it, and those assumptions can have large impacts on our estimates of how likely an event was. For example, what if we though the chance to get a heads on a fair coin was 60%? Then we would assume that we would get 4 Hs in a row almost 13% of the time, which as you can see greatly changes our estimate of how likely the event we observed was How does a monte carlo simulation help? By using a monte carlo, we dont make any assumptions about the distribution, instead we let the data tell us what the distribution is and make our inferences on the liklihood based on the simulation.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: how tf do planes work??[SEP]As someone who works in aviation, that is a very challenging question when answer must be understood even when explained to a kid. I would like to share what worked for me... Airfoil. Remember this term. It is the name of what is called shape of aircraft wings/propeller blade but we can focus with wings. Flat bottom, curved top. Just like your hand, try to imagine. Form your hand like floor flattened, that’s an airfoil. Not sure if everyone experienced this but extra caution and adult guidance is needed if to be done - riding as a passenger in a vehicle with windows open. While traveling, I extended my arm outside the window and formed my hand floor flattened as if it was a plane with matching swoosh sound effect (to boost imagination). Floor flattened hand form is pointed forward, same direction travel of the vehicle I am in. This is where the magic starts to happen. Try to point your hand a little bit upwards. You will see (and feel) that your hand begins to float or continuously move up with less effort from your arm. The air that passes below your hand helps to push your palm up. Just like vehicles, planes do also have engine to accelerate and move forward but since planes has wings (in the shape of an airfoil which we demonstrated like your arm), the upward movement is possible/enabled which is called “lift”, hence, how planes fly.

4.0,"ELI5: With all the rather drastic effects to a woman's body during pregnancy, how do some women give birth not knowing they were pregnant?[SEP]Usually, as a foetus grows, it becomes very visible. Sometimes - very occasionally - that is not the case. Either a woman is overweight and the pregnancy is not visible because of that, or the baby simply does protrude. It seems impossible, but it does happen. These women can look entirely not-pregnant the week before giving birth. It’s a bizarre and very rare condition. The women that this happens to also tend to have sporadic periods, or else their periods continue through their pregnancy - something that can happen during any pregnancy. It’s not a real period, it’s something called spotting. But if you don’t know you’re pregnant, and are used to light periods, how would you know the difference?",0,0,0,1.0,0

What advice and reassurance do you have for grad students with ADHD worried about their own future?[SEP]Well, I wouldn't say I've ""made it,"" but I'm doing ok! Everyone's advice to work with your own rhythm is spot on. I take my pomodoro method one step further and have an app that blocks certain apps on my computer while I'm working, I highly recommend that. Also, I have an email client that compiles all of my email into an app with minimal bells and whistles, and it also keeps me off our web-based email service. I see my email at many points through the day, but I only answer three times a day. Once in the morning, I spend ~30 minutes dealing with email. Once around 2pm I'll respond to messages that have come in. And then once again around 7 (from home; it's unavoidable). Somedays I skip one (or even 2) of these email sessions, depending on what's in my inbox or how busy my day is. But this helps me massively, because I will go down an email rabbit hole, much in the same way I am writing you a novel now... And definitely find your work rhythm and productivity windows. My work schedule is something like this: Wake up and putz around my house talking to and watering my plants while I drink coffee. During this time I'm actually going through all the tings I want to do in the day in my head. It seems like such a trivial part of the day, but on days where I can't have time to myself in the morning to think and talk to myself, I'm off. Then I start work, at home, in my PJs most of the time, but I have a dedicated work station at home. Emails always. Then some writing or lecture fixing; any work I need to get done but don't need to be on campus to do. Then, I do need to get to campus at some point. So, I shower (sometimes exercise) get dressed and go to work. This is a good little break for me. (This also works out because the custodians who got to campus at like 2 am are now going home for the day, and are just leaving their primo parking spots). When I get to my office/lab I am ready to work again, hopefully. I typically take a B vitamin (Floradix) here too; its totally anecdotal, but I feel like it helps me focus and to feel less tired. I try to force myself to take regular breaks for lunch, and I like to go for a walk to get coffee in the afternoons. My point being-- I have a weird work schedule, but it *works* for me. The hardest part of productivity for me is that I really want to uni-task. I want to devote all of my time and attention to say, my paper revisions, but that can't really happen because there are classes to teach, and committees to snooze through. When I am struggling, I will look at my calendar and figure out if I can swing a day that I can block out to just devote to the one thing I want to really really delve into.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"eli5 How are natural resources like minerals and ores scattered around the place?[SEP]Minerals are the building blocks of rocks, which may be made up of a single or many minerals. Minerals can be simple and made of a single ingredient, like how diamonds are made of only carbon, or many ingredients, like clays and micas. So there are many minerals, and while most are common and not worth much, some are valuable because they are either useful to make machines or computer parts or jewelry, and they are hard to find and hard to extract. The rock that contains the valuable minerals is called ore. Iron ore contains minerals that are made up of mostly iron, enough to make a profit after you dig it up and separate the iron from the rest of the stuff. So that’s minerals and ore. They are found in deposits, and these deposits can take many forms. Here are a few: Placer Deposits: this refers to ore found in fluvial (river) sand and gravel deposits that has been weathered from a rock upstream and deposited downstream. They can be found as components of sedimentary rocks that have already lithified, or in active streams. If you’ve ever planned for gold, you’ve been hoping for a Placer deposit. Hydrothermal ore-forming processes: hydro=water, thermal=hot. The water in the ocean as well as the water contained in the cracks and pores of rocks deep beneath the earth’s surface are full of dissolved minerals. When hot water full of dissolved minerals is rapidly cooled and depressurized, as it does in volcanic and geothermally active locations, it interacts with the rocks and can leave deposits of minerals behind, as well as change the chemistry of existing rocks. The La Escondida copper deposit in Chile is one of the largest in the world and is the result of hot water, magma, and rocks interacting deep below the surface over tens of millions of years. You might see that a placer deposit may well originate from a hydrothermal deposit, and the gold that you can find with a pan in the foothills is the same gold that you need dynamite to get to up at the source. In geology we talk a lot about the rock cycle, how minerals are sort of along for the ride as they form different rocks and are cycled through the earth. Ore is a rock and takes the same path. Some deposits are locked up deep in a mountain or below the surface. Some are mixed up with the sand and gravel in a river bed. Source: I like rocks",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5: Why can’t people just code in more digital money whenever they want to?[SEP]Bitcoin and those styles of decentralized currency don't have a central database to hack. Every transaction/mining operation is verified by the entire network (everyone who is mining), so you'd need a majority of those people to be in on the scam in order to pull it off. If you report a different transaction than everyone else, your transaction gets discarded as ""incorrect"". Centralized systems like banks use double-entry bookkeeping. That means that, for every addition to an account, there must either be a subtraction from another account (transferring funds) or a physical input (cashing a check or depositing cash). So the system admin would have to either fake transactions from real accounts (in which the owners would quickly find out) or try to fake a physical interaction (counterfeit money or a fraudulent check) in order to gain money for themselves. It should be self-evident that, if you're making counterfeit money that can pass bank inspections, you're in a far different tier than hacking bank accounts. And the banks' digital security is generally very good.

IP addresses identify your ISP; your ISP is likely able to map an IP address (and the time it was used) to a given customer. So law enforcement, or someone who works at your ISP, can probably determine your real-world identity from your IP address. A random person on the internet is far less likely to be able to do that; what they are likely to be able to do is identify your rough geographic area, through a variety of techniques. (The network layout of many ISPs--the IP address, but also the route to get to that IP address--often gives away some rough geographic data, at the city level; a number of services also exist that aim to do better (more accurate, finer grained) IP geolocation from other data sources.)

5.0,"ELI5 how do we measure the height of mountains?[SEP]Old surveyor here... Traditional methods (before GPS) would require using surveying instruments ([Transit or Theodolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite#Transit)) to measure the required angles. The basic process is straight forward: 1. Establish a ***baseline*** \- a line between two points, both of which have an unobstructed view of the peak. Lets call these points ""A"" and ""B"", and the top of the peak ""P"". A&amp;B are usually far enough apart to ensure the peak is viewed from a significantly different angle. The length of A-B can be measured directly if the two points are directly visible from each other, or indirectly through a ""transit line"" ( a series of intermediate points where the distance/angles are measured along the transit line, and the A-B distance is subsequently calculated). Its not unusual for the baseline to be many km in length. 2. At points A &amp; B, measure the vertical and horizontal angles from the baseline to point ""P"" using the theodolite. The Theodolite is capable of measuring angles very precisely - down to the arc-second in modern instruments. 3. You now have a triangle where you know the length of one side (AB), and the horizontal angles PAB &amp; PBA. From this, you can derive the length of sides AP and BP via trigonometry. 4. You also have the vertical angles (the angle of the lines with respect to the horizon, or level line). With these vertical angles, and the distances, you can determine the *relative* elevation difference between points A, B, and P. 5. The last component, and the most difficult, is determining the absolute elevation (related to sea level) of either point A or B. This is accomplished by referencing some local benchmark whose elevation had previously been determined through a similar procedure as described here. That is, somewhere, there is a benchmark (monument) of known elevation (established through this procedure), that the surveyor must measure the elevation difference to - this benchmark might be hundreds of km distant. The surveyor must use the above process, multiple times if necessary, to measure to said benchmark in order to establish an absolute elevation. Also, the curvature of the earth can be compensated for during the calculation, and is required to do so if the distances are a few km or further. Old time surveyors were bad-ass! They had to haul large amounts of equipment over unforgiving terrain, sometimes for months, or even years, carefully making measurements and checking everything multiple ways to get an accurate survey. All in the middle of nowhere. There are many famous surveyors in history - including George Washington.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Most women go through hormonal changes through their cycle and when they are ""ready"" this hormones makes them want to have more sex to not waste this chance.

4.0,"Are logical deductions more true than inferences from empirical observations?[SEP]I think you correctly identify the weaknesses of the kind of 'everyday reasoning' you describe and the kind of 'logical deduction' you described, but they represent two extremes on a continuum. So, really, the contrast between 'inference from observation' and 'logical deduction from premises' is too quick. For instance, we can make inferences from observation about premises that are then used in logical deduction about stuff we haven't observed yet. This is how Einstein deduced that during a solar eclipse we will be able to observe stars that really are behind the sun, because the sun will bend the light coming from the stars and so that it will kind of curve around it. Later Eddington observed that this is what actually happens. That is what the hypothetico-deductive method is all about. So, in a way we can use deduction to figure out what must be true given that the premises are true, but deduction can't really be used to tell us which premises are true. Observations can give us leads about the truth of the premises, but (as you point out) they can also lead us wrong. Another thing that is important to take into account is that it makes quite a difference what it is you are trying to figure out. In questions to do with abstract entities such as you find in mathematics, geometry, and formal logic (where you don't rely on observation at all), then there you sometimes can seem to find axioms that are self-evidently true (neither true by observation nor deduction). Euclidean geometry is built on 5 self-evident axioms (there are complications with one of them, but lets ignore that here) like 'the shortest path between two points is a straight line, etc. Given their truth we can deductively infer a lot in an a priori fashion. Point is, deductive reasoning seems to work pretty well for figuring out such abstract truths, but for figuring out stuff about physical reality it seems we have to rely on observation. We can however still use deduction there too, but it becomes more uncertain since we seem not to be able to determine any self-evident premises.",0,0,0,1.0,0

In order to achieve orbit, a rocket is shot straight up initially in order to get through the densest air that is the source of a lot of drag, but then they are pitched over so that they are eventually travelling sideways, parallel to the Earth's surface. They continue to accelerate for a long part of that manouver, because objects in orbit are basically falling just like anything else would - it's just that they are travelling so far horizontally during their fall that the Earth's surface curves away from the object at the same rate that the object is falling toward the Earth, resulting in net zero altitude difference. An object in orbit is simply just travelling sideways really, really fast. In order to slow down a spacecraft from orbital velocity, theoretically you could turn to face the opposite direction and thrust for the same amount of time to get back to zero horizontal velocity, but this would be extremely expensive in terms of fuel consumption and the upstream effects on rocket design to carry all that fuel and get it up to orbit in the first place. Instead, rockets make use of the atmosphere to slow them down. A short initial burn in the direction opposite of travel is used initially to cause the spacecraft to fall out of orbit, but then aerodynamic braking in the atmospheric air is actually used to take off most of the speed. The thing is, a deorbiting spacecraft is travelling so fast that air simply can't move out of the way fast enough, so instead it compresses in front of the advancing spacecraft, forming a shockwave some distance in front of the physical hull surface. This adiabatic compression generates an immense amount of heat that the spacecraft must be protected from, which is what heat shielding tiles are for. The attitude of the reentering spacecraft is controlled, and the shielding oriented properly during the reentry to protect the vehicle until it slows down sufficiently to land or deploy a parachute. If the vehicle is not controlled or sufficiently protected from the reentry heat, it burns up.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Where is the tractor?) *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle, which is the greatest kiddy book of all time, and then a lot by Oliver Jeffers and almost anything by David McKee. We borrowed loads of stuff from the library, even more than nowadays, and that gave us all sorts of things I'm not going to remember. When we got to chapter books at ages 5 and 7, we started with Roald Dahl (literally everything over a year or two) and *The Chronicles of Prydain* by Lloyd Alexander. Ages 7 and 9 saw *Harry Potter*, which they were probably a bit too young to fully appreciate, but which everyone else was already watching the films of. Also *A Series of Unfortunate Events* by Lemony Snicket and then his *All the Wrong Questions* series. Ages 9 and 11 were dominated by the *Un- Collection* (*Uncanny*, *Unreal*, *Unbelievable*, etc.) by Paul Jennings. Tehy were awesome. At the moment, ages 10 and 12, we are finishing off the *Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children* series. It's certainly not my favourite, but the kids really got into it. Add to this numerous different novels about horses and princesses, Greek legends my wife tells them and stories she makes up for them, stories I've made up for them, as well as the ones we make up for them together and it's a lot of stories and reading.

Start with a flat square sheet of paper, roll a tube, then try and create a nice flat fold on one end, a cylinder with an open top and closed bottom, see how messy the folds are and how difficult it is to make it stand one its own. You cannot fold a cylinder to have a flat top and bottom plus design an easy pour mechanism with one sheet without creating weak points during the folds. The piece would crimp and pinch, these are stress points that could tear and spill your product. It is similar to but not exactly the same as the [Hairy Tennis Ball Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4UGZEjG02s). With the same flat square sheet you can make nice simple folds to create a square tube, which you can then easily fold into a close at one end.

Some much darker than others no doubt. The notion that the Quest might fail was in the forefront of his mind as well. Part of the theme of LotR is trusting to faith &amp; friends, that not every problem will have a distinct and exact plan to be carried out to solve it. It was enough to know they had no other option, what else was there to do than start, and keep going? Frodo reflects on this even, how is he going to destroy the Ring? He doesn't know ultimately, but it is his responsibility to try, and every step towards Mount Doom was a small victory over the darker road of fear. This was a road Saruman went down it seems, and he turned to trying to control the outcome through might, trickery and force. Gandalf rejects this road when he rejects the Ring, and many times before. And in the end it was enough, Frodo brings the Ring to Mount Doom, with much help and much effort, where his previous pity and power come back to reward him (in a way) and everyone with ultimate success.

I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5 'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe. This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly.

You'll want to introduce carbon in the steel for strength so will need to find a way to create carbon in the steel so most likely burnt trees or bones from animals. Now you've got the crucible, the ore, and the carbon you'll need a form. Easiest is a sand relief form for the barrel and required other metal bits. Ideally you'd be a machinist and or an engineer.

5.0,"What makes us the same person over time? Am I the same person as I was yesterday? What about 10 years ago? Why?[SEP]Most philosophers do indeed believe that personal identity is in some way real (except Peter Unger sometimes, sort of Ted Sider, sort of Galen Strawson, some Buddhists etc.). There are very broadly four camps. Those that believe we persist in virtue of: * Psychological continuity, which is to say that continuous psychological relations are what's important (Derek Parfit, David Shoemaker, Sydney Shoemaker, David Lewis, Hume, Peter Unger sometimes etc.). This is the most popular view amongst philosophers, and comes close to Locke's memory criterion, but generally with more detail. * Biological continuity, which basically says we are animals and our persistence conditions are that of human animals (Eric Olson, Peter van Inwagen, Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, David Wiggins etc.). This is the second most popular view, but one which has grown in popularity in recent years. * Souls or dualism or similar, which says there's something immaterial that we are, which accounts for our being (Richard Swinburne, Dean Zimmerman, Peter Unger sometimes etc.). A number of views sit in this one, but it's the grouping you'll find most theists in, and a lot of dualists (but generally not property dualists for example, who would be more likely to subscribe to the psychological view) * Anticriterialism, which means you are the same person between moments because you are the same person. No further analysis is possible or necessary, and identity (of any object) is simply one of the brute facts of the universe (Trenton Merricks, Marcello Oreste Fiocco, Ned Markosian sometimes etc.) This one sometimes goes hand-in-hand with dualism for example, but often is still entirely materialist. Personal identity is my particular area of specialism, and I don't know which account is right. I lean towards animalism over the psychological view, but I take anticriterialism and nihilism very seriously. Part of the issue is that wider philosophical themes are very important to this discussion - particularly mereology and time. There's no agreement on the nature of time, and until such a time (pun intended) as there is, we will struggle to make a ruling on personal identity.",0,0,0,0,1.0

You see the word annoying is objective and relies on each individual’s personal taste. So you can’t make such a broad question and expect such a simple answer. The truth of the matter is that something that one person finds annoying, might be endearing to another. So what truly is annoying except the absence of what is socially expected? “Out of the norm,” if you will. And society is headed to complete social collapse if we continue to use the word annoying without context. Some people find nero-divergent people annoying. But that’s wrong of them because their is no set standard for what truly is normal. I could say it’s normal to be an astronaut, but that doesn’t make it true.

You don’t ever have to ask more than a simple “how are you?” Or “how have you been?” If it’s been a little while and generally showing a very basic interest in their well-being (a polite thing to do) will tell them that your a nice person but doesn’t take much for you to do, you also don’t really have to care, if they talk for longer than you wanted to cut them of with a quick “I’m glad/sad/happy to hear you are good/unwell/stressed, but I really can’t stay, I’ve got a pressing email to address/meeting to get to/call to make.

In Greek-colonized Sicily they founded cults that basically invented modern mathematics. But an underrated empire is the Dutch Empire. They never really held onto territory that well but they founded a lot of trade ports, explored a lot of the world, and invented practically free trade as a positive concept (though some British people advocated for that before).

5.0,"ELI5: How are scientists able to tell how old a rock is?[SEP]There are already several very fine answers to this question so I want to address some issues that non-scientists sometimes have trouble with, The first is the idea of accuracy vs precision. Accuracy is the closeness to the correct answer, precision is a measure of the smallest unit that can be determined. It is thus possible to have a very precise answer that is absurdly inaccurate. Getting an accurate answer requires one set of conditions, getting a precise answer requires a different set. Both sets must be met to have a good answer. Another issue that comes up is the age of the rock vs the age of its constituent grains or minerals. In the case of volcanics getting an age date on the time of crystallization of some of the minerals is not the same as getting the time of eruption. And in sedimentary rocks there is the time of deposition of the grains, the time of solidification of the cementing minerals, the possibility that some of the cementing minerals may be at least partially dissolved and then new ones precipitated in the voids. All three will give different ‘ages’ for the rock. A third issue that affects sedimentary rocks is that of erosion, transportation, and redeposition. This one can be particularly tricky if one or a very few fossils are used to give a date. In a particular instance I encounterred a few years ago the law of superposition indicated one age but the included fossils indicated a much older (like about 100 my older) date. We resolved the issue by comparing the fossils in questionable bed to those in other beds and noting that the fossils in one were heavily eroded as would be expected in the stream deposited sands and pebbles of the younger formation while they were vey shap and well defined in the older formation from which they had been eroded and subsequently transported.

One thing I particularly appreciated was that a range of eras were represented by the translations all the way back to the Elizabethan, so you not only got a sense of Roman literature over time but also how English translators responded to it in their various ways.

4.0,"How did Kant determine on which level to classify an act?[SEP]&gt; As I understand it, Kant determined that lying was wrong because if everyone did it, we would hate that. No, this is not true. Insofar as we might say that Kant anywhere defends the view that lying is always wrong, he would be presumably doing so using one of the forms of the categorical imperative. Those being, roughly: 1. Such an act would fall under a maxim which cannot be willed to be a universal law. 2. Such an act treats a person as a mere means. 3. Such an act is inconsistent with considering each rational will as a universally legislating will. 4. Such an act would fall under a maxim which is inconsistent with being a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends. I take it that, perhaps, you are imagining it violates the first one, but the first one does not involve checking maxims against what people hate. There are a few proposals about how the first formula works, but among them are things like: the maxim cannot be willed to be a universal law because...(1) it contains a logical contradiction, (2) in a world where this rule exists the proposed act is imprudent, or (3) a world where this rule exists is generally inconsistent with the agent's requirements for a world.",0,0,0,1.0,0

The technology has also facilitated important cuts in fuel use and tillage changes, resulting in a significant reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions from the GM cropping area. **In 2018, this was equivalent to removing 15.27 million cars from the roads**.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645698.2020.1773198) [Although GE crops have been previously implicated in increasing herbicide use, **herbicide increases were more rapid in non-GE crops**.

4.0,"ELI5: Why do adults suffer from diabetes and other conditions more than children?[SEP]There are two types of diabetes, aptly name Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder, meaning that the body mistakenly recognizes the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas as foreign invaders and destroys them. This is why all Type 1 diabetics need to take insulin: they can't produce their own. Type 2 diabetes is different in its mechanism in that you still have the ability to produce your own insulin (for the most part). However, your body either doesn't produce enough insulin, or your body becomes desensitized to the effects of insulin (also known as ""insulin resistance""). This occurs when there is always so much glucose (sugar) in the blood, that your body keeps trying to contain it by releasing insulin. However, the cells where the insulin does its work eventually stop paying attention to the insulin. It's kind of like the boy who cried wolf. The insulin keeps saying there is too much sugar in the body, but the cells say ""well, we can't have too much sugar ALL OF THE TIME, right? Insulin is exaggerating."" So they stop listening, and don't take up the amount of sugar needed to keep the blood sugar level in the healthy range. This whole process takes a long time, so children usually won't have type 2 diabetes. It takes many years of poor diet and exercise habits before one will develop type 2 diabetes.",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"ELI5: What is an Eigenvalue and an Eigenvector?[SEP]Not really ELI5, since if you know what vectors are then that's already above ELI5 level haha Eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the behavior of linear transformations—i.e. transformations of space that affect the space in the same way everywhere (e.g. stretch/squish space by the same amount everywhere) and also that keep the zero vector in place. (Perhaps another way of thinking about linear transformations is that they transform straight lines into straight lines, parallelograms into parallelograms, triangles into triangles, etc.) For some random linear transformation, most vectors will be transformed by a combination of rotation and stretching (so they'll be rotated by some amount and elongated/shortened by some factor). Note that the rotation amount and scaling amount is not necessarily constant for a given linear transformation—it depends on the specific vector being transformed. Interestingly enough, there are often some vectors that the transformation will transform only by scaling, with no rotation at all; these are the eigenvectors of the transformation. For each eigenvector, the amount by which the transformation will stretch/shrink the eigenvector is called the eigenvalue of that eigenvector. For instance, if I take the transformation of the plane that ""flattens"" all vectors onto the x-axis (the orthogonal projection onto the x-axis), then the eigenvectors of this transformation are (1,0) and (0,1). (1,0) lies along the x-axis, so it isn't changed at all, so its eigenvalue is 1. (0,1) lies along the y-axis, so it gets collapsed down into the zero vector, so its associated eigenvalue is 0. (If you're paying very close attention, you might notice that (2,0) and (0,2) are also eigenvectors, as are (3,0) and (0,3), etc. In fact, any multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector. So when we list out the eigenvectors of a transformation, we usually just list out one eigenvector from each ""family"" of eigenvectors, with the understanding that any multiple of the given eigenvectors will also be an eigenvector.) Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful because it's really simple to describe what the transformation does to them—it just scales them by some factor! So if we apply the transformation many times to an eigenvector, it'll just get scaled by the same amount over and over again. In contrast, it can be difficult to predict what applying a transformation to an arbitrary vector many times will do to that vector. Moreover, if a transformation happens to have enough eigenvectors, then we can actually completely characterize the transformation by taking note of how it transforms all of its eigenvectors—i.e. by noting all of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This can make repeatedly applying the transformation very easy, since we can just reduce a more complicated transformation into simple scaling of certain vectors.

It will help that person recover and heal as well, or it may not affect them at all, but we can benefit from forgiveness either way. And who is to say who doesn’t deserve forgiveness. I believe there are more people who have done something wrong and truly hope to make up for it, learn from it, move on than there are people who can completely ignore the consequences of their actions. That being said, my forgiveness can help them recover and do better. It may even serve as a lesson for them to follow. I’ve even seen people treat me more kindly on the whole when they see how forgiving one can be. Hate and resentment are too strong of emotions to carry with you all of the time. Forgiving the “wrongdoers” helps keep you on a path of humanity and patience. Once you are able to forgive someone for something that seemed unforgivable, you will see many things in a new, more compassionate light.",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"If Dormammu lives in a reality where time doesn't exist then how is he talking and communicating?[SEP]What is time? From a standpoint of physics in our dimension, time can be defined as the direction of change in a system in which entropy increases. But that isn't true of the Dark Dimension. In the Dark Dimension, physics exist as Dormammu desires them to exist (within some limit, that limit being the potential of the various universes he has conquered). So time, as we understand it, does not exist in the Dark Dimension, however *change*, and even, if so desired, *linear change*, does, especially when you take into account that *our dimension was leaking into his and vice versa*. The portal opening was allowing our concept of time to leak in. The Infinity Stones only work in the universe they come from, if our universe's linear time hadn't leaked into the Dark Dimension the time stone would have been useless. Comprehending what non-directional entropy time looks like when the dimension is closed to us would be...difficult. Concepts like what you said, causality, the most basic, fundamental realities of our universe break down there. In the Dark Dimension, if Dormammu wants it, two plus two really does equal fish.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is simply glucose molecules strung together. Your muscles keep a small supply on hand to do their job, and your liver is where your body keeps most of it. Gluconeogenesis: how your body makes glucose from smaller molecules when the supply of carbohydrates runs low. Some cells must have this because they can't run on ketones--like nerve cells. This normally doesn't happen since it's easier to convert other carbohydrates into glucose instead. Ketogenesis: how your body makes ketone bodies. This is how you get energy out of fats and amino acids. They're converted to ketone bodies that most of your cells can feed into the mitochondria to produce ATP. The ones that can't need the gluconeogenesis above.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I live in a left wing part of the US so guns are not very popular where I live so I would try to make a ranged weapon. This could be a knife attached to a pole or just anything sharp in general. The second thing I would do is get as much supplies as I could get. I have a few trees at my house and these could be kind of useful but I would not rely on them. I would scavenge around the house to see if I could find anything that can watch water (Buckets, Bottles that I can cut in half) These can be used to get water whenever it rains. This could help us dearly when the cities water supply is cut off. I would also start planting crops for food just in-case we have to stay here for a long time. I suggest also try to scout out the area and see if its safe. I would also try to contact my neighbors to see if they are friendly and if they are infected or not. This would help us form a bigger pack and could help us fight better against the zombies. I live fairly close to a supermarket and Walgreens so after some time I would head down there with some survivors and try to scavenge as much food and supplies as possible.

And it also works for microphones as well. Think of it like the door frame of a house. The door itself and the house are changed constantly as time goes on, but the frame remains the same because it serves its function. The only thing that changes with a jack is the headset itself which can enhance quality profoundly while still using the same jack your $1 low quality headphones do. However, there has been improvements in the tech. It's called bluetooth. Bluetooth negates the need for the jack altogether. But if you don't want to charge wireless stuff constantly, the standard headphone jack invented in the 50s works even with the highest quality surround sound headset in 2021.

The answer was the dog was my best friend dog companion that I’ve had for 14 years and the women screaming was my wife who was watching me curl and uncurl and make weird sounds. Apparently my dog sensed something was up and hopped in my lap and kept licking my face. I was fine with not remembering my wife but I was convinced something was wrong because I vividly not remembering who the dog was.

5.0,"ELI5: When did Northern Ireland split from Ireland and join the UK and what caused it?[SEP]For centuries, Ireland was a harshly oppressed colony of England, subjected to brutal taxation and other associated mistreatments. After WWI, the Irish found the timing and supply of modern munitions and battlefield experience to be sufficiently in their favor to «diplomatically» advocate for independence. By 1922, the IRA had essentially harried the English enough that Ireland was conceded to the Irish, save the six counties of Ulster that have a higher protestant/pro-English population than the rest. So technically, it was Ireland that split off from Northern Ireland, not the other way around... and it still took decades for an uneasy peace to be reached - while Ireland became independent in 1922, Northern Ireland remains a point of contention, though fortunately one that is having a lot fewer bombs thrown about in recent years.

4.0,"[Star Wars] How large is the memory bank of an astromech like R2? He’s seen so much. How can he remember so much information?[SEP]Astromech droids have a comparatively massive amount of storage space, given their highly technical jobs. They must be able to store a huge variety of not only blueprints and instructions for repairing thousands of different systems, but hyperspace navigational computations and other large complex files. Many astromechs are manufactured with only the bare minimum information installed (which is still a lot), and the owners are expected to either manually upload any necessary information to them, or allow their own internal learning systems to handle things that weren't programmed into them. Because of this, many astromechs have a very large amount of empty space at all times. And properly maintained astromechs who get regular memory wipes keep it that way. R2D2 could likely run for many more decades or centuries before running out of storage. It also helps that astromechs don't need to hold such extraneous information like speech patterns and multiple languages like protocol droids do.

Animals which thrive based on human generosity and companionship. But animals such as bears, lions, whales, moose, eagles, penguins, seals, fish, bees and generally all other insects would greatly benefit from human influence being reduced. But that's really besides the point, humanity isn't bad in itself, but the problem is that there's too many of us and we have too many wasteful habits. If there were say 1 billion humans on this planet instead of 7,8 billion humans, our species environmental impact would be far lower, there would be room for other species to live and thrive and we wouldn't out-compete them for resources to the point where they go extinct.

The really crazy part was the new ""menu"" introduced by the show. There were only about 3 food options and 4 ""signature cocktails"". I think everyone at our table ordered burgers, and they were unbelievably bad. The patties were basically spherical, some were raw, the buns were literally just mush with grease. Absolutely comical. The cocktails were uniformly terrible as well (also wildly overpriced). The one I remember best was a burger shot. Kinda like a bloody mary except they literally just scraped some burger bits off the griddle and tossed them into the drink. It was actually worse than it sounds.

Look at baby pokemon for example, you can easily find them in nature, but if you try to breed their evolved counterparts by themselves, you would skip right by the baby stage if you don't have them hold a Incense, which they most certainly don't need in nature. Or look at legendary pokemon which cannot breed at all in captivity, yet we know of several eggs or baby versions of some of them. This is especially telling in Manaphy, which which in captivity can only produce eggs containing Phione, yet we know explictly [that eggs containing Manaphy exist in nature.](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Diamond_(Adventures)#Raised) So my conclusion would that there are indeed wild pokemon that Braviary can breed with to produce eggs containing Rufflet.",0,0,0,1.0,0

If the scene does not matter to the ending - cut it out. If you have several paragraphs of backstory that really do not help us understand how the protagonist makes their decisions to lead them to the end - cut it out.

Property is largely defensible, although there are a few areas with easily accessible windows. I have lots of boards and tools in my basement so I can probably rig up some protection to keep them off my deck, and seal up a couple sticky windows. Nice thing about the pad is that there are mudrooms on entrances, and two doors between you and flesh eating zombies is better than one. I can pop a skylight and access the roof from my bedroom. The roof is entirely unavailable to zed although there is nowhere to go when you are up there and it is very steep, so you're basically hoping for helicopter rescue if it gets to that point. I should add a rope ladder to my bedroom closet in case of such an eventuality. Anyhoo as long as I don't get rushed, once the apocalypse dies down a bit and before the zed in the major city centers have dispersed, I'd probably be pretty ok for a while anyway. I only have a couple weeks worth of food in the house, but I mean who has a month on hand. Currently I have solar power but it becomes useless when the grid goes and IM not an electrician.

5.0,"[Marvel Comics] Why does Thor wield a magical hammer that grants people the power of Thor?[SEP]&gt;Why not find a weaker being who is worthy and give them the powerful weapon so that there are actually more worthy Thor-tier beings in the universe? See Thunderstrike and his son, who is also now Thunderstrike. Mjolnir in fairness is a convoluted mess that keeps getting retconned into different things. Iconic story is that Odin placed the Worthiness Enchantment on it while robbing Thor of his powers - basically sealing the powers of Thor in the Mjolnir. In this setup anyone who is worthy would literally wield the powers of Thor, while Thor himself doesn't have any of his powers. I don't actually know at what point this stopped being the case - I think it was during one of Thor dying/resurrecting events where he kept all his divine powers even without Mjolnir. The enchantment stayed however, so anyone worthy would still gain powers of Thor. Most of the magical duplicates of Mjolnir, like Stormbreaker axe and Thunderstrike mace were created back when Thor still depended on Mjolnir for his powers, so they were forged to keep more Thor-tier dudes in game. In addition: Where it gets complicated is in current year, I think with Jason Aaron run, although it might have been introduced earlier when there were plots about young Thor - because apparently now Mjolnir is somehow almost sentient weapon and worthiness enchantment doesn't work anymore and the mallet itself decides who it wants to wield it - which is how we got Jane Foster Thor. Also it apparently has some sort of cosmic storm sealed in it, instead of powers of Thor. Also Mjolnir was destroyed and reforged before and after that revelation on separate occasions, so who the hell even knows nowadays what's the deal with the Worthiness Enchantment and the Power of Thor.",0,0,0,0,1.0

In that case some of the towns people might not be aware the bridge needs repair or are even oppossed to repairing it (sometimes for good reasons). * Some people don't even believe there's a bridge: ""There is no bridge, it's all just a \[insert hated group here\] conspiracy"". Followed up by a lynch. * There is actually no bridge or no problem with the bridge. It literally was just the mayor making campaign noises to avoid other (more difficult) issues in the town.

5.0,"ELI5: What Causes JPEG Compression?[SEP]Storing every pixel as a separate data point gets *really* expensive real fast when you're dealing with images consisting of millions of pixels. That's why compression formats exist. The two main types are lossless (which conserve all the data so a picture can be exactly reproduced) and lossy, which make sacrifices and remove some data in order to reduce the file size. For example, jpeg groups an area that's approximately the same color into one big square and writes the information of 50 pixels as only one or two large pixels. If you do this once it saves a ton of storage space and since our eyes don't actually perceive pixels the same way as a computer does, the image still looks nearly identical. If you do this many times however, you end up with multiple passes of an algorithm that compound the mistakes and approximations of the previous pass. Kind of like the telephone game that we played in kindergarten, each pass loses a bit more information. The best way to avoid it is to share the original image instead of compressing it again. Don't take a screenshot, but instead directly download the image for example. That way the compression is already written in the image and your phone doesn't need to do it again. Edit: jpeg does a lot more than just that obviously, but that's the most prominent feature that gives it that blocky look",0,0,0,0,1.0

It's still worth playing but it's a poor substitute for Skyrim. Still my favorite though even though it's almost 20 years old now is Morrowind because you really have to pay attention to the story and missions.

A slightly more technical answer is: TXA prevents the formation of the protein plasmin from plasminogen. TXA is chemically similar to the amino acid lysine and binds to lysine receptors on plasminogen. Plasmin degrades the protein fibrin. Fibrin together with platelets forms blood clots. So TXA increases the levels of fibrin leading to clotting. TXA isn't a direct thrombotic. It's a reversible inhibitor of the protein that degrades fibrin.

5.0,"Eli5: why do kids hate vegetables?[SEP]You have part of it. But the question has many multifaceted answers, developing taste buds are a part of the puzzle. From a behavioural point of view, you can think of it as a display of power. Kids crave power and control, which sounds bad because our immediate thoughts are of adults that crave power and control. But remember kids are born completely dependant, and as they develop they naturally want to have some sort of influence on their environment. One of these things is what they eat. Because parents can't force you to eat, which is why it's common for kids as they get a little older to become picky eaters, they've realised that this is an outlet where they can have more control. It's one of the first things which them saying 'no' tends to have an impact. Vegetables tend to be a villain because they're healthy and parents want their kids to eat them. They get pushed more, and that pushiness makes kids want to flex what little autonomy they have. Then it becomes a game of stubbornness. They may very well like the food but they'll still 'not like it' because they want to be right. This can turn parents into forcing their child to eat vegtables against their wishes creating bad associations with the food. Again this is just another piece to the puzzle. They're a lot of factors at play here.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Is it all combined or different tank ?[SEP]This is one of the coolest patents I have read. The multifuel engine is based on a diesel engine. The problem with using lighter oils like gasoline and ethanol in a diesel engine is that it will detonate too soon, before the piston is at the top. There are a few changes they have done to prevent this. Firstly there is a mechanism to adjust the injection timing depending on the fuel. This was quite revolutionary at the time using mechanical systems but is now pretty much standard on all engines. But they also use a bit different injectors which does not spray the fuel in such a fine mist but instead coats the hot piston in a film of fuel to evaporate. This makes the injection timings much more similar between different fuels. Another issue is that diesel is its own lubricant so injectors and the fuel pump is actually lubricated by the fuel. So they had to change these to be lubricated by engine oil. The disadvantage to all these changes is that even though the engine can run on all fuels it will run quite badly on every fuel. Fuel consumption is high, it is underpowered for its size and it burns though lots of engine oil. They do run better on diesel then other fuels so this is usually what they use. However the concept is that in an emergency situation where diesel is unavailable they can use other sources of fuel and just mix it into the fuel tank. Especially if the engine is already warm it should be able to run on almost anything. Military vehicles do often have multiple fuel tanks they can switch between and it is a good practice to keep some ""good"" fuel in a seperate tank to make sure the engine is able to start and warm up before switching to the fuel tank with the dirty fuel.",0,0,0,0,1.0

To get to 100 GB with 50 000 images they only need to be 2MB each. Digital cameras and telescopic mounts can be remote-controlled. So you can set it up so it captures lots of images of the moon while the telescope tracks it. You will take a lot of images of the same part and stack them to reduce noise and show parts that emit very little light. They can also remove images that are bad for some reason like an aircraft passing through the field of view. There are special programs for this. Stacking is very common was tor capturing faint objects in the sky. You can then stitch together the images that are outputted by the stacking program is dedicated panorama programs or even in photoshop. I looked for something that matched it and found one without the 100 GB part and it state was the program and equipment was used.

The microcode will then be told to ignore these portions just as above with clock gating so it can steer traffic accordingly.

5.0,"ELI5: How does 3D printing work?[SEP]There are several different 3D printing technologies, and they all work a little different. That said, the most common one in consumer grade printers is fused deposition modeling (or FDM). In this particular technology a plastic ""wire"", called filament, is fed through a nozzle just barely hot enough to melt it, which causes it to stick to the surface under the nozzle. The nozzle is moved via computer generated commands in a pattern that builds up the 3D shape one layer at a time. The second most common is stereolithography (SLA). In this technology the printing medium is a UV reactive liquid (called resin) which hardens when exposed to light. A screen at the bottom of the printer lights up the resin at the correct points to harden it as the build plate slowly pulls it out of the tank. This technology is capable of MUCH higher detail than FDM printing, but the resin is messy and toxic, requiring the use of rubber gloves and significant post processing to make the prints safe to handle. I believe the resin is also expensive compared to FDM filament, but I can't say for certain on that because I don't have a resin printer (my house is not well ventilated and my cats are stupid enough to try to drink the resin).",0,0,0,0,1.0

The only raptors that Muldoon encounted were kept in a cage and delivered food. The hunting patterns of dinosaurs are just a huge unknown with almost no comparable animals alive today. Mammal techniques are not the same as bird or reptile techniques. All knowledge of Raptor hunting techniques are merely theoretical and based upon advanced paleontology. Muldoon can read the same sources as Grant, but without the same science background as Grant Muldoon probably can't grasp the why, or understand the potential holes in the conclusions due to limitations of paleontology. Muldoon can only read the conclusion and take it at its word with no understanding of why two different papers might disagree or where the researchers are making assumptions to fill in the gaps of fossil knowledge. Grant however probably wrote some of those papers on raptors and understands the debates and arguments better. Grant knew which pieces of evidence were missing from the papers and thus could quickly change his thinking and reasoning when the missing evidence manifests itself infront of him. Muldoon probably can't. It short, Grant knew the short comings and evidence gaps and could adapt, but Muldoon could only take flawed research as gospel.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Sloppiest kind of depends on what the letter before or after it is and if it's a ""loopy"" letter. I tend to like, slur those together when writing.

If you live on a new me level home and this is a bathroom, take something in the bathroom to cover you from debris but will not suffocate you. 2. Let your loved ones in your family and neighbors or coworkers know your plan. If it is a bad tornado people will need to know where to look for you if it is a shelter, bathroom, or if you opt to always head to your local tornado shelter. 3. Invest in a bugout bag and weather radio to take with you that has some supplies. In case you ever are caught in the center of a tornado you may want a medical kit, water, etc on standby. 4.

5.0,"ELI5: Why does driving at high (interstate) speeds and hitting standing water (deep enough to splash) cause you to feel a push perpendicular to your car's movement?[SEP]Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies. So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum. Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin. (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU) Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"How to start writing an adaptation?[SEP]This is probably not common practice, but what I do is read through the book and highlight all the dialogue and quasi-dialogue (i.e. ""she told me her plants were like her children""), all the actions, and make marks where the action isn't continuous (like if there's a flashback or a jump forward that isn't the start of a new chapter). Then I use color coded sticky tabs to track the scenes that forward the main plot, the b plot, and (if relevant) the ""past"". Next I break all those into scenes and make a list of all the scenes with the characters that appear in them, where they happen, and a sentence or two saying what the major event is in the scene (so: MC scene 4, batman and Alfred, Alfred gives Batman a device to bypass Bad Guy's shields) After all this, I start transcribing, scene by scene, what I've highlighted into my scriptwriting software. While I do this, I tinker with dialogue, trim some fat, clarify some things, and at the end I have a script that's WAY too big, but now I have something to revise, and I probably don't look at the book again, because my script has everything in it.

Adidas once commissioned a bunch of short-film style ads from a bunch of different creators for their [adicolor](https://vimeo.com/95786097) line, and all of those ads were published along with detailed info about who made them, for example.

We were wandering around and I was scared of the dinosaurs but felt safe because she was with me. We see a ""long neck"" eating some leaves off a tree. She tells me they're safe because they don't eat meat. He wanders over to us and speaks. He looks right at me and says, ""I'm going to eat your mother."" Then he bends his long neck down and eats her. Not in one smooth move.. She was half way down his throat with her feet and legs sticking out of her mouth with his head up in the air like a snake swallowing something that was too big. After he swallowed her whole, he bent his head down to me, looked straight in my eyes and said, ""Now I'm going to eat you too."" And then I woke up. Terrified. I'm 36 now. Still remember that nightmare with perfect clarity.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"Thinking about cutting off family with no explanation, would that be best or not?[SEP]Cutting family members off with no explanation is usually done when you are convinced there is little or no chance of the relationship getting better, and even the thought of trying to make it better is painful. Since you were going to invite four family members to the wedding, I suspect the relationships are not that far gone yet. What you should do, I think, is talk to each person and set very clear boundaries around what you are going to accept from them and what you are not. For example, to your older brother: ""I would like to have a better relationship with you. For that to happen, you must stop being rude to me, stop bringing up painful incidents from the past, and stop talking to me about older sister. You are entitled to have your own opinion about her and your own relationship with her. And I am entitled to have mine. I am not going to have contact with her, and when you tell me to do otherwise it causes me nothing but pain. So please do not bring any of these things up. And if you give older sister information about me against my will, I will not be able to have contact with you either."" To your mother: ""I appreciate that you want me to have a relationship with older brother. And I am now trying to do that by setting boundaries that I hope will allow us to be more civil with each other. However, it hurts me when you make excuses for his bad behaviors. He needs to take responsibility for those. So I have decided to stop bringing my complaints about him to you. I don't think that is doing any of us good. Instead, I've decided if he can't respect my boundaries, I'm just going to stop talking to him as I do with older sister until he sincerely apologizes and makes amends. You may think this is unfair or harsh, but I need you to respect my decision on this."" It is then up to you to point out to your older brother and mother when they have crossed your lines. You can say something like ""I asked you not to be rude to me. I am not going to talk to you when you act like this"" then hang up the phone or leave. You get to decide how many warnings they get before you cut them off completely. If they try to contact you, you can respond with ""I would like to talk to you, but first I expect an apology for \_\_\_\_\_."" Be consistently firm and they will change if they really want a relationship with you. P.S. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, and your English is great.",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"If moral error theory turned out to be true, would the way we live our lives be any different?[SEP]This exact line of reasoning is what led me to leave moral realism and become some kind of expressivist - because I know quite a couple of error theorists and they're all just as moral as the next person, and all seem to understand that even though they think error theory is true, it is still wrong to harm others, steal, etc. While i was a moral realist, I was becoming progressively more convinced of error theory (mostly for queerness reasons). But when I thought - 'error theory is true, therefore 'it is wrong to harm others' is false' and started contemplating the pragmatic consequences of this - that I had no reasons other than prudence not to harm others - I always felt 'but I still have reason not to harm others'. I realised that even if I became convinced of error theory, I would still feel, think and act as if I had a reason not to harm others. There are a couple of ways to interpret the feeling that 'even if error theory is true, harming others is still wrong'. The first is that its just a mistake - moral habit prevents us from implementing the consequences of our beliefs. Just as thinking 'I shouldn't want cigarettes' doesn't make the cravings go away, accepting error theory doesn't make one amoral (its worth saying that error theory doesn't endorse immorality either - it just rejects that normativity exists in any strong sense, so it doesn't 'endorse' anything). I rejected this line of reasoning because I think for a belief to seriously count as a full belief it has to have consequences for how we reason and how we act, and error theory doesn't seem to have any such consequences. Another interpretation of this is fictionalism, which endorses error theory, but says that moral concepts are still \*useful\*. They are like mythic stories used to predict seasons or the rain, or that teach children lessons and make us all behave. They are false, strictly speaking, but they serve some purpose. Again, this struck me as unsatisfying, as it provides no prohibition against abandoning morality if one finds it no longer useful. But my experience of morality is that it is non-optional - that its norms still apply to you even if you don't believe in them and choose to ignore them. Anyway, at the end of the day the fact that even if i became convinced that moral facts don't exist \~out there in the world\~ my behaviour, practical reasoning, and the way I feel the normative force of morality, wouldn't change convinced me that moral facts aren't supposed to exist \~out there\~ (which both the error theorist and moral realist accept) but somehow emerge out of what it is to be human and the ways we interact with each other. It helped at the time that I was becoming a global expressivist in phil of language, and started seeing all linguistic behaviour as normative, so it was easier to abandon spooky, queer normativity in favour of normativity of a more mundane sort that arises out of being the kind of creatures that we are. Bit of a ramble but I guess I'm saying I think its a great question that leads to very interesting philosophical places.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Just a side story - not related to the topic, but anyway - When I again was at a big scoutcamp in 2012 I had my own phone - and the way we got power was that we had appointments at a tent where there were a bunch of excersise bikes. A few times a day, people from my group had to go there and bike for an hour. In return we could get our phones charged, by turning them in in a box - with the phones already connected to our chargers. So when we gave the box to some people, they would put our chargers in a cable - and using this power created with the biking to charge phones.

4.0,"Is Bourdieu’s theory of habitus deterministic? More specifically, is cultural capital determined by economic capital in a linear way, or can someone acquire cultural capital, even if less likely, beyond that which is associated with their class?[SEP]My sense is that, in Bourdieu's original conception, ""having an interest"" in high culture wouldn't be similar enough to ""participation"" in high culture. The argument being that a person who grows up appreciating fine art through images in books would not share the same degree of familiarity or breadth of knowledge as the person who regularly flies around the world to see it in museums and galleries. On the other hand, our enterprising bookworm would have more cultural traits in common with a globe-trotting art lover than with a globe-trotting horse enthusiast. I think within that framework it could be argued that individual *capacity* for developing a specific set of social markers is deterministic. For example, I could share a passion for baseball with the scion of a wealthy family, but my memorization of player stats would create a habitus that is fundamentally and irrevocably different than being able to fly around the country to watch games, meet players and owners, etc. I couldn't recreate that experiential base (hence Bourdieu's hypothesized links between the different capitals). On the other hand, our jet-setting sports fan might have trouble navigating the social niceties (such as they are) of a local dive sports bar. Our habitus would be determined in the sense that we are limited to our respective social circles and spheres of experience, but the direction of our development within our potential cultural capacity would be controlled and informed by our personal interests and exploration.

5.0,"How can someone improve their handwriting?[SEP]Practice. Try first forming each letter individually until you're happy with your shape for each one, pay particular attention to 's', 'r' and g as these are letters that people find hardest to replicate consistently. Once you've done that practice stringing different letters together. A string of 3 letters lets you try each permutation fairly quickly. For example if you're practicing drawing an 'e' get used to drawing it before and after tall, medium and low letters. Note, unless you're in school you don't need to do actual cursive, but some people find it faster to join different letters together. But as long as it's legible and easy to draw you can develop your own style. Once you're comfortable running letters together, now practice for speed. To do this just write a lot by hand. Concentrate on keeping the letter forms consistent, whilst also reducing the time needed to make a word. I like to keep written lists like shopping lists, to give me regular practice to keep the skill up.

To give an example, I can share something silly: When I laugh at something, I text LOL right? But my friend just keyboard slams like HDSFJYAJKHG and as weird as it is, it's just her way of communicating that something is absolutely hilarious. I found myself slowly doing that but that doesn't mean that we are losing our personality but it means that we're growing and feeling comfortable with ourselves around them enough and attach something they do with us. This is a really weird trait and I have always wondered why I did it but I can assure you a lot of people do it. I don't necessarily think it's due to me being insecure but maybe saying it that way sounds like I'm projecting lol. Don't feel weird if you do it.

Without catching feelings/things going sour?[SEP]Friendships in general don't last forever most of the time so you really have to enjoy relationships while you can. Something could always happen that makes one or both of you want to back out. As far as catching feelings, that's all about what you want for yourself far more than it's about the person. If you're a lonely person who feels like you need a boyfriend/girlfriend and to tell yourself you're in love and you have a soulmate and that whole deal, you'll probably romanticize the person and the relationship and pine for them. If you're not and you don't, you're probably fine because what you want is to have fun and do some specific things. (For example, making out. Or cuddling. Or maybe you drop L-bombs because it's a turn on for one of you. Hypothetically, of course. Ahem. Or you like holding hands. You get the idea.) And you do those because they're also fun. If you want to do some things you think are fun and kind of cheesy and fuck your friend, that's great. You can totally do that. I think it's worth it and I enjoy it.

The empty bottles were put back into the six pack flat and returned to the grocery store where you would get a nickel back for each one (some states gave more, and those were usually listed on the top of the bottle). The bottling company would pick them up, sanitize and refill them at their plant. We did this all the time. I had an uncle who would go along the road side and collect unbroken refundable bottles for spare change (he was just a kid at the time, too). I seem to recall this phasing out sometime in the early to mid-80s with the onset of plastic bottles and aluminum cans becoming more popular.

Now, take that group of people, split it in half, and put each half several hundred miles away from each other, or like, on two sides of a really hard to cross mountain range. These two halves will now slowly start to sound less and less alike as each half adopts new mannerisms/slang/pronunciations that could really just stem from someone mispronouncing a word and it not getting corrected and it catching on to the point where the group now believes that the correct pronunciation. And when you’re separated from the other group/not constantly talking with outside groups, those deviations don’t ever get corrected.

Whether they turn immediately after ending the pedestrian signal or some time after is also a decision based on road width and traffic flow. Sometimes you want to leave the intersection clear of foot traffic for a while at the end of the cycle so that cars can turn, and you don’t want to strand a pedestrian in the middle of a wide road by quickly turning the signals.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"What's your ghost story?[SEP]This one is lengthy and will be a pain to type on phone but here goes: my buddy's house he used to live in with his parents was haunted. Some nights back when we just graduated high school, I would get a sense of uneasiness but would just listen to music and fall asleep. Then after a while, each night it grew progressively worse until the last few times of staying the night were by far terrifying. First it went from simple uneasiness to full on hearing things. I would spend the night in the guest room and have music playing in my ears all night so I wouldn't hear the sounds. Well, one night I didnt have it. I heard feet shuffling through the carpet as if someone woke up to check on me. They all slept upstairs while the guest bedroom was downstairs by bathroom, kitchen, and main door. I sat up to hear the footsteps come to the door and then stop. You can just feel it that they were peering in but NOBODY was there. Then hearing the feet shuffling back up the stairs. I tried to make nothing of it but the footsteps were loud like someone physically was making rounds. Finally after a few times, I mustered the courage to go spot them like it was my buddy trying to mess with me (just remembering brings tears into my eyes) and what I saw was not my buddy... But a pair of slightly transparent feet in socks shuffling toward me, stopping mere steps away, then turning to the bathroom on the right and walking in there. I hauled ass up to my buddy's bedroom to wake him up but he wouldn't listen. He claimed it was the wind (not windy at all), its the rain (wasnt raining that entire week), it's ANTS! (Yes, the wise man has been a marvel!) I gave up and was forced to return to the guest room terrified. How could I sleep? What can I do? I prayed and prayed, I didn't have my music player at all to distract me. I would hear the rounds again (upstairs to each room, down the stairs, in the living room, dining room, then my area then back up) but each trip they would come further into the room, watch me, then leave. First was lingering at the door, make a round then just in the door, make a round then at the foot of the bed, THEN AT MY SIDE OF THE BED! I was praying, begging, pleading for God/Jesus to help me. Finally came to the last round and final time I ever laid in that bed. After it stopped at the foot of the bed, waiting... Waiting... Not leaving... Suddenly, a terrifying sensation crept throughout my body. My fucking hair on one side of my body stood on end with goosebumps, adrenaline rushing, heart beating 100+ beats per minute, as the sensation overwhelmed me slowly from leg up to my head as it enveloped the entire side. Then out of fear I couldn't really move... I needed to, I wanted to but it was like I didn't know how... As it got worse and worse, more and more intense, you just know what is happening but can't stop or control it. You feel ""invaded"" and that horrible negative intention is outright terrifying. It's a pressure that gets more intense but you don't feel crushed. Chill down the spine, you feel the intention in the air like AC too high and malice. I eventually overcame my fear and forced my way (somehow) out of that room, rushed up to my buddy's bedroom, woke him up again, had to give him a video game of mine to convince him stay up with me as I waited to leave. Bastard still laughs at me and tells people ""lol, he thinks my old house was haunted!"" Fuck that, never again! TL;DR: growing paranormal activity lead to a near possession at a friend's townhome.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: Why does hot coffee that goes cold taste bad, but iced coffee or cold brew taste fine?[SEP]long time specialty coffee barista here. ""specialty coffee"" is used to denote high-quality beans that are sourced directly from farms, not bought on the commodity markets. the roasters we worked with were extremely dedicated, and the product was often very different than what most people are accustomed to. a light-roasted high quality coffee should have a color like tea, a clean body (not thick!!!!!!!!), and a juicy, flavorful, sweet flavor. good coffee is truly more like tea than the coffee you'd get at starbucks or dunkin donuts, to the point that those latter drinks are almost unrecognizable as coffee to me. here's my point. if you're drinking GOOD coffee, it tests *best* at lower temperatures, somewhere between hot and room temperature when the flavors have had time to develop and it reaches a temperature that won't scald your taste buds. it will continue to taste good as it turns lukewarm and cool. so if your coffee tastes bad when it's cooler, it was never good coffee to begin with. as such, i cannot really answer your question, as the premise of the question (""hot coffee that goes cold taste\[s\] bad"") is itself flawed. but i'll try to answer somewhat. iced coffee that you get at many shops is simply yesterday's brewed coffee poured over ice. if that tastes good to you, then that's great, i'm jealous! at best, it's tolerable to me. i make no apologies for being a snob so save your breath if you want to call me out on it. cold brew makes good coffee because for whatever reason the low temperatures never extract some of the harsher notes from even low-quality coffee. i suspect that most places are doing a better job at filtering cold brew, because partly why warm coffee that goes cold tastes bad is due to unfiltered solids continuing to brew, leaving bitter/sour tastes.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It is because the voice you hear whenever you speak is a bit pitched. It is more ""mature "" or deeper. The reason behind this is this. You hear your own voice differently because it hits you directly. It comes from you and there are other paths within your head leading to inner ears where those voices of yours could very well travel.

She was trying to get title back into her name, and the guy would promise to sign a deed and then not do it. We had a real estate paralegal who did a search on the property and prepared a deed which transferred the property to her. The guy agreed to meet with the woman and me at his home (not the house in question). He was a smirky jerk. He taunted the woman and me about transferring title. I showed him the deed and asked him to sign it, not expecting him to do so. I was sure we'd have to sue to clear title. He looked at the deed. ""You want me to sign this?"" I said yes, and he did! I was shocked. He smirked. The woman wailed, ""But that's not his real name. That's his fake name!"" I told her that was the name he held title to the house. HUGE wipe off of the smirk on him and big change to smile on her. I went back to the office, gave the deed to the paralegal, who filed the deed and got title back in her name.

4.0,"ELI5 why there is a gas shortage in the eastern US?[SEP]The gas pipelines are controlled by computers. The people working at the sites use computers all the time for various things. All the sensor data is collected to computers. I have not seen any detailed information about exactly what they are doing and why they have to shut down the pipeline. However it is likely a precautionary measure. It is not unusual to take all computers offline after such an attack in order to scan them for any hidden software. If you leave some computers on it is possible that the malicious software might be able to copy itself between the computers and you may never get rid of it or even detect it. They are able to shut off the pipelines during this work because they know that the gas stations have enough gas in stock to delay the delivery for a few days under normal circumstances. New fuel deliveries are scheduled as normal at the end of this week. But just to make sure they did not go dry many gas stations increased their prices a bit which is an effective way of driving customers away or at least get them to wait until the end of the week to fill up their tanks again. The biggest concern is truckers, ships and airliners who are the big consumers of fuel and are therefore actively checking fuel prices everywhere and are able to change their plans to add fuel stops outside the effected area. However this backfired big time. People knew the fuel pipeline had shut down but did not know for how long and they saw the fuel prices starting to go up. So instead of running their fuel tanks a bit drier then normal a few enterprising people hoped to make a lot of money buy buying all the fuel that the gas stations had and selling them for highly inflated prices. So all the fuel that was supposed to be available at gas stations for people who could not wait until next week to fill their trucks is now locked away in crazy peoples garages.

5.0,"ELI5: What do the songs we like do to our brain that makes us like them and why does it differ from person to person?[SEP]Musical taste is generational, and cultural. To avoid deviating too much from eli5 territory, it has to do with sound waves. The sound waves have ups and downs, they look like mountains and valleys. A soundwave has a frequency, the word frequency by definition just means ""how often something repeats"" so the frequency of a soundwave tells us how ofteb the mountains and valleys repeat. If its a high frequency soundwave it means it has many short, but often repeating mountains and valleys. If its a low frequency it means it has longer, less often repeating mountains and valleys. In music, the word melody means ""sounds that are played after eachother"" and harmony means ""sounds that are played at the same time"" (like a chord) Generally the sounds that we find ""harmonius"" or consonant, are sounds where the frequencies of the sound waves align. This means that the two sounds being played together, has the top of their mountains meeting at a close point, and so its valleys. A soundwave with double the fequency will always align, even though one of them is higher. This just means that for every 1 mountain and vallet for the lower soundwave, there is 2 mountains and valleys for the higher. The octave is double the frequency, and is considered the most harmonious. But if you play frequencies where the mountains and valleys do not allign, it will often sound like the sounds clash. This is called dissonance, and its the reason why a miss-played note in a song sounds very out of place. However, dissonance is not always bad. Music generally works by building tension by using dissonance, and then resolving that tension with consonance. Songs are kind of like telling a story, you cant just have the good parts, there needs to be some tension as well! But its also very very cultural. Ive described music out of the western 12-tone equal temperament system but there are many many more systems in the world, with different notes. This is why middle-eastern music may sound out of tune for someone who is not raised there. But if you grow up with that kind of music it sounds very natural.

5.0,"Byline got updated to include someone else, is that fishy?[SEP]Legitimately, only the person/people who wrote the article – i.e. the author(s) – should be credited. I can only think of maybe three reasons they would change the credit: * Straight-up plagiarism. For whatever reason, they want to take (some of) the credit for your work. This is shady AF and, if this is what's going on, you should have it corrected. * A technical glitch. On the content management platforms I'm most familiar with, it's hard to imagine how an article would accidentally get credited to an additional author... But there are a lot of different technologies out there they could be using, and it's certainly not inconceivable that this could somehow happen in the course of migrating between different platforms, or even just due to a mistaken click when trying to do something else. * Since the original publication, the article was updated without consulting you, and the person who wrote the update(s) is getting legitimately credited for their contribution. Given you said this was an article about technology, and technology changes fast and articles about it often need updates to stay current, this seems like a pretty likely scenario... But would usually be pretty obvious. When I've seen this done, there's usually a note at the top or bottom of the article noting when it was last updated. TLDR: No, this isn't normal. It could be nefarious, but there also could be a legitimate explanation. So just email them and politely ask what's going on.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: Why is the jaw the best place to punch someone if you're trying to knock them out?[SEP]The jaw isn't the *best* place but it's a vulnerable place nonetheless. This is because it's fleshy compared to the rest of the head. The temples of the head are rigid and connected to the jaw, and the skull is very thick, thick enough that it can actually break a person's hand if they attempt to hit it. The jaw is different. Above/adjacent the jaw there's a hollow opening (the mouth), and it's filled with air and soft muscle which offers little resistance to force. In other words, it's the soft underbelly of the head. This is bad news for the recipient of the punch. Their head will go from one position to another very quickly causing the brain to crash against the skull (unconciousness). That being said, knocking someone out is very dangerous and should really only be a last resort in a fight. It's not as simple as the movies show it to be.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"What are the physics behind power consumption/ how does a battery drain in a closed circuit?[SEP]A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy. The chemical reactions in a battery involve the flow of electrons from one material (electrode) to another, through an external circuit. The flow of electrons provides an electric current that can be used to do work. When you connect the battery to a lamp and switch on, chemical reactions start happening. One of the reactions generates positive ions and electrons at the negative electrode. The positive ions flow into the electrolyte, while the electrons flow around the outside circuit to the positive electrode and make the lamp light up on the way. There's a separate chemical reaction happening at the positive electrode, where incoming electrons recombine with ions taken out of the electrolyte, so completing the circuit.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Like it's not just my body they're seeing, they're seeing me. As for the people who come after my looks? If someone is that shallow, why should I care what they say? I know emotions don't listen to reason, so it's not always foolproof. Words can cut deep. But I promise you are beautiful to someone, probably many someones.

5.0,"ELI5: why do we say “uhm” when we’re thinking? I’m multilingual and it seems to apply to most languages. What makes it so “universal”?[SEP]Uhm and similar sounds are [filler words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_\(linguistics\)). Their main purpose is to signal that the speaker isn't done speaking. Often times we need a half second to think of what we want to say next. If we let that moment fill with silence, others may take that as a sign we are done talking and then start with their own thread. Filler words serve the purpose of signifying we have more to say. This is a universal problem. It is not surprising other languages have come up with their own filler words. Eliminating filler words from important speeches has the benefit of making the speaker sound more worth listening to. Someone who is used to being worth listening to wouldn't be worried about others interrupting their speech with their own. So we naturally give more weight to those who don't use filler words. In day to day conversations between friends though, filler words serve an important function.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Check a book out of the library or find a GOOD website with correct information. Both from a science and biology standpoint and an emotional and social view.

It's really important to set some concrete boundaries on what behaviors you will and won't tolerate and how you want to be treated, otherwise people will use you and manipulate you because you're empathetic and kind. It's also paramount to recognize that you are doing that person a disservice by not allowing them to learn from the consequences of their actions, thus hurting their growth.

5.0,"Can you have more than one agent?[SEP]So, there are situations where people have more than one agent (at the same time). Off the top of my head, a couple of examples would be: –when you're branched out into new genres/categories the original agent does not rep/does not wish to rep. –your agent is in the UK/US but does not work with co-agents in the US/UK, so you get a seperate agent on the opposite side of the pond. But from what you've said, this doesn't apply to you. It sounds like you have a case of 'the grass is greener'. You have an agent, they've sold (or are shopping) your work (so those manuscripts remain with them), but now you want an additional agent for new work.... am I getting the gist right? In this scenario, you are unlikely to be able to have 2 agents. After all, your agent gets a cut of what they sell, so how would that work with 2 agents? Are you planning to cut your original agent out of new deals? Because, why would they be okay with that? Likewise, why would the new agent want a second voice in the mix? Are you even willing to give them both 15% a piece? So essentially, you have to choose: stay with your original agent, or allow yourself to get poached (it sounds like new agent approached you?) and hope it goes every bit as well as you expect it to and that the new doors open. The fact is, writers change agents all the time. Yes, in a perfect world, the first agent you land with is your perfect fit and you both enjoy a career long partnership. In the real world, this rarely happens. But it's a gamble to move agents when everything is going well - so the real question is: what makes you think new agent is going to open more doors?",0,0,0,0,1.0

Is it possible to convince them that patience can do more good than punishment?[SEP]I think it really depends on the individual and your relationship with them. Some people are open to reasoning and integrating different experiences and worldviews into their own perceptions, but some people will only follow advice and really \*listen\* to things they're told by people they very deeply trust, or people that are reinforcing their current biases. If you're looking for tools to try to persuade people to think critically about their actions or biases, maybe check out r/StreetEpistemology. From what I've gathered, the point of the sub is to provide advice and techniques for basically leading people to conclusions that match your own experiences/worldview, instead of just telling them they're wrong, because people react negatively towards having their perceptions and biases challenged. Rather than challenge them directly, you basically just keep asking why it is they think/feel the way they do until you get to root causes of their thoughts/feelings, and make them examine it, help them to question whether or not what they are thinking/feeling is correct, or morally sound, or productive, etc, etc.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5: Why does ""turn it off and on again"" work (and so often at that)?[SEP]It's starting from a known good state. There's an acceptable level of inaccuracy in both electronics and machinery, but they can both move out of position. In machinery, this could be a 1mm tolerance for wobble on each part, but once it gets to 3mm it'll bind up. If you have (4) parts the first part going back and forth +1 to - 1 is just fine. But if it leans a bit, over time it'll nudge the second one towards the + side more often, so that next one is bouncing between +2 and 0. That's not ideal, but still works. Each movement it leans farther from ideal. Eventually a part ends up being a problem because it's been nudged too far by repeated action. Stopping everything let's it all fall back into the starting rest position. By starting at zero those little nudges have all been removed (until they work back in). In electronics, for various reasons a piece of data can get stuck or simply not reset to it's default position. Think of a 3way light switch. If you usually use one switch, you know which way is usually on for that one. If someone flipped the other switch and did not flip it back, now your usual switch is backwards. You setting the your usual switch to what you expect to be ""on"" does nothing.

Some are more chill, usually the ones who inherited their wealth and never really have to work. The other type, the actual people who earned their wealth, they are super smart and don't suffer a fool whatsoever. So they can be a bit short on words and they expect solid results quickly. But even them, if you are direct and competent, the interactions will always be fine. The only bad interaction I've had was with a fool who inherited his money, but who fancied himself ""self-made"" and ""entrepreneurial"". These men and women are the worst. They are the ones who become super entitled, and they get super mad when they are corrected on things. And because they are idiots, you must constantly correct them, but in a tactful way... They ask for unreasonable things, get mad at pointless little nonsense, etc. Yeah, these people suck. But they are extremely few.

4.0,"ELI5: In music, what is the difference between remixing and remastering an album?[SEP]Mixing is the process of taking everything you recorded and deciding how you want all those tracks to fit together. This includes each individual track's EQ, compression, effects, panning, and volume compared to other tracks. Once you have the final mix, which is all the tracks bounced down to a single track, you send that track to be mastered. Mastering involves sending that track through equipment (or plugins) and adjusting the overall track's EQ and compression so that it sounds great on all kinds of listening devices (headphones, computer speakers, high end speakers). Now that audio technology is digital, there are newer tools for manipulating, editing, and visualizing sound than when the Beatles recorded their albums. I imagine the original stems (each part of a mix, like drums, vocals, guitars) were digitized and cleaned up using computers algorithms to make the tracks sound clearer. Once you remix tracks, you have to master the new mix as well.",0,0,0,1.0,0
5.0,"ELI5: How do distance sensors work with angled surfaces?[SEP]If you had a perfectly smooth and level surface, this would be an issue. However, surfaces aren't perfectly smooth so the light really gets scattered in pretty much all directions.

Take a laser pointer and point it at an extreme angle at a surface. Notice how you can still see the light reflected back at you just fine and you don't see it reflected onto another surface. Now do the same with a (clean) mirror - you'll likely barely see the light on the mirror's surface, but see it strongly on wherever the light is reflecting to off of the mirror.",0,0,0,0,1.0

I answered his question he shook his head and I heard him mumble ""fucking know-it-all"" while writing something down.

I said no so he tried to blackmail me by saying he'd tell my parents I'd agreed to have sex with him if i didn't send him a picture.

4.0,"Where did all of the Hummers go?[SEP]I assume you mean civilian hummers like the H1, H2, H3. You still see some of them on the road. But they stopped selling hummers over a decade ago. So when cars are stopped on production, they tend to fade away because no one is buying new ones. So as they get into accidents or fall into disrepair they get scrapped. Same with how you see very few pontiacs left on the road these days, since Pontiac hasn't existed as a company for quite some time. You never see a Hudson anymore... etc. Also, civilian hummers were not very reliable. So once production stopped, they all fell into disrepair very quickly, which is part of why they went away so quickly. Also, they were terrible on gas mileage, and gas shot up in cost in the 21st century. So more and more, people who owned hummers traded them in for better cars.",0,0,0,1.0,0

He could tell you things about yourself that you'd swear you never told anyone. He could wave his hand over you and describe exactly what you were feeling, and what you were seeing in your imagination. When practicing he would often say things like 'did you feel that?' the instant anything changed or happened (i've been able to do this with my students before as well). **the real superpower** I've managed to do it once or twice myself without him. We used to practice a type of feeling outside the body meditation. I swear that when practicing with him I could feel all the walls of the room around me, I could feel the people walking by on the sidewalk, I could feel the studs in the wall from across the room. I can still do it, but only within about 10 inches of my hands, when i was practicing with him i had a range of about 30-50 feet with much higher resolution.

5.0,"ELI5 What is Non-euclidean geometry?[SEP]Euclidian geometry assumes that everything is flat. Non-euclidean geometry abandons that assumption. For example: In Euclidean (normal) geometry, the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180°. That's grade-school geometry. But on a sphere, you can make a triangle with three 90° angles. (Just imagine Earth, one point on the north pole and two points on the equator, a quarter-way around the planet from each other; relative to the surface, the lines are all straight, but the angles are all 90°.) Of course, this isn't really a triangle in the 3D world, only in the 2D world of the sphere's surface. But if the 3D world is itself not ""flat,"" then the 3D shapes we know might look very different in 4D, if that's a thing.

There was even a pond that had a dock with a couple picnic tables, and that was my favorite spot to take my lunch to on nice days. I also loved that, if I needed to get away from my desk and clear my head, I could just leave the building and go on a walk without worrying about traffic, random strangers, or being hassled for being away from my desk. And it was almost always quiet--I rarely ran into other people on the walking trail or the outdoor sitting areas. I was blown away that more people didn't utilize them.

It also suffers from the stigma when it came out that people dropped out of college to play it. Star Wars is probably the least nerdy because it has really strong pop cultural connections, but it can get REALLY nerdy. Star Trek is up there, because it is not as hip as Star Wars and has a more philosophical focus than an action on. Magic is VERY nerdy. Probably tops the list of these.

The principal would sometimes ask me to come to his office... to ask me how to get from one place to another.

He may or may not be the same entity as The One Above All, the most powerful Marvel entity, Marvel has been vague about that and fans tend to fill in the blanks themselves. Jesus has been depicted as the son or avatar too Yahweh, Adam was a member of the Fallen Stars created by the Creator (another possible Yahweh) and merged with the Nexus of All Realities and is the ancestor of Man-Thing. An evil aspect of him also tried to destroy mankind and fought Ghost Rider. Moses was human but worked miracles threw Yahweh, such as when his staff turned to a snake in his confrontation with Pharaoh's sorcerer, who became the immortal Sphinx. His staff was later used by Solomon Kane. King Solomon was a human Sorcerer Supreme. His legendary Brass Frogs of time travel were in his tomb in Wakanda.

5.0,"ELI5: How does pitch relate to tuning in music?[SEP]Pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound waves so higher frequencies = higher pitches. Amplitude is defined by the size of the wave so bigger waves generally = louder sound (there are some tweaks to this like perceived volume based on human physiology, but for ELI5 bigger waves are louder). When you are asking about tuning, the 440 is a reference pitch by which everybody tunes. The instruments tuning will probably have different amplitudes (loudness) but they will all be referencing the same pitch (440 Hz). The progression of the reference pitch upwards from 440 to make it brighter in practical terms means they are just all agreeing to a different reference pitch. F#, A, Eb and other identifiers like that are notes that represent pitches since it's easier for people to say give me an A than it is to say make your instrument give me 440 Hz. By the way, the relationship of pitch to amplitude is that humans perceive some pitches as louder than others even though they might all be at the same sound pressure level.

One of these elements is right behind the visible pupil or iris. It is called the lens but, confusingly, it is just one of the parts that is helping to bend the light into focus. It is important for its ability to change shape though. When the lens gets pulled on by some small muscles it changes shape from more curved to less curved. This variation in shape changes the focusing distance of the whole eye assembly. A stretched, less round, lens causes targets that are far away to be in focus while a relaxed, more bulbous, lens leads to things closer to the eye being in focus.",0,0,0,1.0,0

The physics comes in handy when thinking about units, spectral content of light, light and surface interactions, things like that. As far as on the job stuff, thats a huge part of day to day. I had to teach myself solidworks, as well as alot of the structure of the company. Like how to utilize all the members of the company effectively to get tasks done. It's a small company and it's very self managed. You have to ask for help when you need it. Like I'm not great at electronics, or if the programming gets tough it's not practical to tackle it myself.

5.0,"ELI5: why does crypto need to be ""mined""? if its digital why cant it just exist?[SEP]If there was no mining, someone could just decide ""I have million coins"". Mininig in this context is not mining. The coins are just created from thin air as real money, but they are not created randomly. If you want to send someone some crypto, you are just adding that transaction to a list. * ""A sent B 10 coins"" * ""B sent C 5 coins"" * ""C sent A 5 coins"" But how to know that these are true? And why can't anyone just alter the history of transactions? (Note: following explanation is simplified version, and might not be entirely accurate) This is where the blockchain comes to play. Let's add all those transactions an perform a mathematical hash function on them, to turn that into a certain length of bits. If might look like this: 098gaa576a2653. Well, that was not very hard. Let's try to find a different hash, such that we get for example 6 zeros at the beginning. Let's add some random data at the end of our list, and also the previous hash from previous block in to the list: * ""78687576567acaa"" * ""A sent B 10 coins"" * ""B sent C 5 coins"" * ""C sent A 5 coins"" * ""00000001"" Now the hash might be: 675gfac6534453 Well, no luck, let's try again: * ""78687576567acaa"" * ""A sent B 10 coins"" * ""B sent C 5 coins"" * ""C sent A 5 coins"" * ""011188811"" Let's try all kinds of random data, until we find a hash, like 000000afa667a Now we found a hash that looks as it should. It was difficult, as we had to try millions and millions of different bits of data to find this. We save this to the blockchain. Because it was very hard thing to do, we get a reward, the coins. This is what mining is. Blockchain is the list of transactions, and their hashes in order. The specific kind of hash was incredible hard to calculate, but it's easy to just check if that is the correct hash. Now if I try to change something, like giving ourself more coins, the hash would no longer be the same. Because the hashes are chained together, everyone knows that someone tried to tamper it as none of the hashes match anymore. We could try to re-calculate the hashes, but that would take way longer than anyone has time, and because millions of users have the original blockchain, no-one would believe if someone tried to cheat.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Are we morally responsible for our actions inside our dreams?[SEP]Are we morally responsible for our actions inside our video games? Intuitively, I think no and it's by the same intuition which I feel about dreams. Importantly, I would rule out agency as a significant factor in the moral status of an action, or at least, suggest that there is some concept that must supercede agency because in video games we do have agency (though you may argue in degrees of agency). I bring this up because I was a natural lucid dreamer as a kid and for a long time believed this was the norm. Not only did I have full control over my own actions, I could freely manipulate reality as I saw fit. If you were to hold me accountable for the knowing and deliberate things I did in dreams... well, it'd be simultanouely worse than any atrocities a person is capable of in reality and greater than any goods a person is capable of in reality. It'd also be very different to how I conduct myself in reality. Why? For the same reasons I can play different characters in video games: role playing. I think the reason is consequence. When consequence is stripped away actions are inherently meaningless and rendered amoral. This supercedes other considerations like agency. I think there's lots of room to get into philosophical weeds here, but ultimately the important thing is that dreams do not impact reality and therefore we are free to act however we please and should not be judged on those actions. There is another angle here, however, the idea that dreams reflect our unconscious self, our biases and tendencies. In this, a lack of agency is exactly the critical factor by which we can purport to access this unconscious self. Should we then be judged based on this unconscious self? Probably not. For the same reason we should be judged on actions, not on thoughts. This unconscious self is not tempered by reason, it doesn't carry our ability to rationalize and consider consequences. This process of reasoning is an important part of who we are, I think, and it would be unfair to take it away and then say ""look how awful your true self is!"". No, that's not me, that's like... some raw ore that has the potential to be me. Okay, okay, but what if you're not aware that you're dreaming, but you're fully agential and rational? Well then you're just going to behave as you would in the waking world anyway. So to synthesize, if you know you're dreaming, you know your actions have no consequences and if you don't know you're dreaming you're missing the ability to rationalize consequences. Either way, you're not really YOU and you shouldn't be judged for the actions you take.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Eli5: How does the forestry industry work if trees take years to grow?[SEP]In the UK, the valuable hardwood trees such as oak, ash and sweet chestnut can take up to 150 years to reach maturity. Several thinnings take place over that time which can be used for a variety of purposes to help mitigate the costs of management but the final crop can be very high value. The idea is to have enough land under forest cover to be able to harvest some every so often as well as doing thinning work, thus ensuring a regular income as well as a varying aged forest which is good for wildlife, providing ecological services such as water catchment management and the future of the business. Historically most large woodlands in the UK were connected to large estates owned by gentry who took a much longer term view of land management than we do now, so planning for a crop in 150 year made sense as well as ensuring work for people who lived on the estate",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Eli5:Why does an edible thing boil when put in water but fry when put in oil?[SEP]You should realize that a boiling liquid has constant temperature. If you put a pot of cold water on a flame, the flame adds heat energy to the water, increasing its temperature. Until it reaches the boiling temperature of 100 Celsius 212 Fahrenheit. At that point, continued heat energy from the flame goes into ""breaking apart"" the water molecules from the rather closely packed liquid state, to the vapor (steam) state. The temperature of the liquid stays fixed at 100 Celsius while this is happening, despite the flame underneath continuing to add heat. So water serves the purpose of *limiting* the temperature of the ""edible thing"" (soup, etc.) so that it doesn't burn to a crisp. With the water gone, temperature shoots past 100 Celsius, and burn-to-a-crisp happens pretty fast. Oil has a much higher boiling temperature than water, but the things that we fry in oil usually have *some* water in them. There's still some temperature limiting, and you usually get the crisp (burn) on the outside, but soft on the inside (where the water ""protects"" from the higher temperature of the oil), like you see with fried foods (esp. french fries). Anyway, the temperature is limited while the liquid is boiling. The same thing happens with a solid melting (ice). Temperature of the whole lemonade is forced to stay at the melting temperature of water (0 Celsius, 32 Fahrenheit) while there's solid ice (still melting) in there. Despite how much heat the hot summer air outside your cup adds to the liquid.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Space expand and drag matter with it. There is no poit from where the universe expand, each cubic inch of space slowly become bigger and bigger. But the expansion of space is very small, so it take light year of space to really see the effect. At small scale the local force that keep the solar system or our body together are far stronger. This is why near galaxy like Andromeda will collide with the milka way in the future. The gravity between the two is stronger than the expansion of space. But as you go further, galaxy start to get away from us because the accumulated expansion in-between is just too big. It's like swimming against the current.

She grew up as an older sister in a rural family, and my grandparents invested a lot of money into my uncle, while she had to make her own way. Eventually she got a good job - and she was good at it too - and she'd spend some money from each paycheck to get some new things for herself. She also got abandoned by my brother's father, which may have contributed to the development of hoarding behavior; definitely made spending money on herself harder as she had to take care of her son all on her own. She'd go on to meet my dad and eventually they had me. In a way growing up around her tendencies to ""keep and save things"" made me more callous towards organizing and tidying in general.

5.0,"ELI5: Why haven’t we made some way to harness lightning energy? A tower maybe?[SEP]According to the internet (clearly the most reliable source on the planet) a lightning bolt contains about 1 billion joules of energy, there are about 20 million lightning strikes per year in the US and there are 3.8 million square miles in the US. So that's about 5.26 billion joules per year per square mile. According to https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56290.pdf a square mile of solar panels produces 1 gigawatt hour. If we assume that only a quarter of days are sunny that's 1.095 ~~petajoules~~ terajoules per year, since solar panels don't work well at night. So if you actually built enough lightning collectors to catch all of the lightning you'd still get about 20x as much energy from the solar panels.

Who is in the wrong?[SEP]I don't know who's in the wrong exactly. Technically if you signed the HOA agreement then you are subject to it's rules like any contract. For teaching the kids to drive, you can just drive off the HOA property and then let them get in the driver's seat. While it isn't on the HOA property, you can still teach them to drive. Most parents that I know of start teaching their kids by taking them to an empty parking lot and then letting them drive from there anyway. There are some workarounds I can see for your problem though. Option 1, store the kid's cars off the HOA property. Then the kids can drive to and from work and then walk to and from the area where they park their cars. So long as the kids can legally drive anyway. Option 2, attempt to change the rule. You pay your dues, you have every right to go to the meetings, ask questions, and propose rule changes. You will have to get this through your HOA committee, but I could easily see you getting the rule changes or getting an exemption. Talk to your HOA, you literally pay them for the right to do that. Option 3, drive the kids outside the property, then let them drive the car while you walk back home. When they come home, walk out to the edge of the property and then drive it back in. From what I can see, and my experience with my own HOA, since you signed the HOA agreement you have to follow their rules. You can try to change those rules or you can work around those rules, but breaking any rules means you can legitimately be fined and it will be a legally binding fine.

I wonder if the Greek word that Aristotle used has all of the same connotations that come with that word in English. It is hard to say, in some instances the translator may swap out Aristotle's choice of word to better convey the modern connotations, this is why translations can differ substantially. Moreover, some words using in the work of ancient Greek philosophers have not satisfactory english translations, examples include *logos*, *tolma*, *ananke* and so forth - whole books have been written on each of those. &gt;... it seems like the line numbers have no obvious relationship. This is because the arrangement of phrases in the ancient Greek language are different to that in English, so the word do not match one to one from the English to the Greek line.

At times I found him staring at my chest even though I never wore anything remotely revealing. He would also try to find ways to stop me after class but we had another class after his, so he would never get the chance as after their classes, teachers had to mostly leave the institute. Once after both of our classes were over, me and my friends were walking on the driveway towards the main gate, when a car entered through the gate was was driving towards us. We got to the side, letting the car pass. As it was around 7 in the evening and also, winter time, we couldn't see who was driving. As we left the premises of the institute me and my friend were talking for some time near the main gate before going our different ways. Were just talking when my friend said, ""Don't turn now but derek (imaginary name) is staring at you from his car."" I was shit scared. I lived alone in a hostel and this creepy dude was in his car, staring at me, the same car, mind you that we had just passed. I didn't want to leave alone because what if he followed me and got to know where I live. Also, it was dark and my hostel was a bit far. Eventually he left in almost 10 mins. All this while he had done nothing but stare. As soon as he left, i ran back to my place. The next day, another one of my friend told me that she saw him pass us in his car, drive for a bit, and then make a huge U turn making a loud screech making all passerby look. I didn't go to his class anymore and changed my section. Still this incident gave me a mild trauma and I would look out for his car every time I left hostel.",0,0,0,1.0,0

There was no dirt around it and it was hanging there by 3 large roots, but otherwise was open to the chasm below it. We’d sit out there for hours, talking and drinking. It was great.

4.0,"Does Making a Man Wait Really Earn his Respect?[SEP]I personally think the idea is foolish. If you want to sleep with someone, then do it. Simple as that. Ideally, you vet the person enough in order to still maintain some level of standards, but that's completely subjective. I have two competing thoughts on the subject. To be a bit crass (but honest), one thought that always crosses my mind is that if a girl sleeps with me that easily, then she is probably sleeping with other guys that easily as well. But on the other hand, if a girl really likes me and ""makes me wait"" but at the same time isn't making other guys wait, then how much can she really like me? And for the record, I think both of these thoughts are completely unfair and recognize that it has a lot to do with my own ego. I'm not someone who views sex as something that *necessarily* needs to be special. I try to treat men and women equally. If I don't look down on a guy who sleeps around but I do if a girl does it, then that isn't exactly fair. But at the same time, if I ever were to look for something more serious then I would want to feel both that a) she is actually attracted to me, and b) that she has vetted me enough to suggest that she actually is looking for more than just something casual.",0,0,0,1.0,0

We all sat in silence for the first 15ish minutes to read the papers. Then he made literally everyone in the class give a reason why the good paper was good and a way that the bad paper could improve. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever witnessed a teacher do, people left that class crying. Imagine hearing 20+ different ways why your paper was terrible. Needless to say I ripped him to shreds on his eval. Side note, he also made a comment about how people who wear Hollister are losers on a day I was wearing Hollister. Not sure if he noticed or not, as it was a nice sweater that had a very small bird in the bottom corner.

At an emotional level I think it's important to allow yourself to grieve even though others may be judgmental because it's ""just an animal"". If you think about it people who are really close to their pets have a very deep connection. There is often more physical contact than there is with human loved ones. There is also a bond built in learning how to communicate without the language and communication styles that we're used to. All of this requires significant attention and connection and for many people, especially those who are emotionally sensitive (which I personally think is a strength) a very rich relationship forms. Overall: Breathe, allow feelings to surface, go through the stages of grief and know that you were both better for knowing each other. I hope this helps.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"With my current level of experience, what is the best avenue of entry into the book industry as an editor?[SEP]A lot of jobs in publishing go to people who have certificates from colleges in publishing programs. It's a really, really tough industry to crack in any meaningful way. My editors (all with bigger publishers) toiled a long time in poorly, or unpaid, internship positions for years before slowly climbing up. There are just vastly more qualified applicants than there are positions, and those positions themselves always seem to be shrinking. As such, 'pivoting' from an outside industry into publishing, at least on the editorial side, is not going to be easy, since there are people who have been trying to crack it directly for a very long time - probably longer than you (and while you've been in a different industry). I don't mean to dissuade you. People say the same thing about writers who make a living publishing books, and yet - people do it all the time! Just because it's tough, doesn't mean you can't do it! One thing to consider might be where you live. If it's not NYC, there are going to be fewer jobs. I actually interned at a literary agency while working on a dissertation. I just emailed the place, met with an agent who needed an agent, and read manuscripts for her. Being a volunteer reader while keeping your current gig might be a good way to get in somewhere!",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"In the book ""Psychobiology of Gene Expression,"" author Ernest Rossi proclaims that mapping the human genome provides us with enough evidence to put to rest discussions of mind/body dualism and the nature/nurture debate. Is this true?[SEP]No, it's not true. Insofar as there is an explanatory gap for consciousness, mapping the human genome did nothing to bridge it. Frankly, even as someone who is skeptical that the explanatory gap is anything but transient, I wouldn't even bring up the human genome in arguing against some kind of mind/body dualism. Nor did it do anything to settle debates about ""nature vs. nurture."" For one thing, it's not really clear that such debates---common as they are among the folk---are even *cogent*: even if we could draw bright lines for what we meant by the relevant terms (difficult!), we can't say of a person, this is the part of them that is nature and this is the part that is nurture, because the relevant causal processes just don't work like that. What scientists actually do is say are things like ""this amount of variation within the sampled population is due to genetics""---but that's a *very* different thing than settling the popular debates over nature and nurture. (Why? Take a classic example, namely studies of academic performance among adopted children. The set up for the experiment is that you find a bunch of adopted children, test them, their adoptive mothers, and their biological mothers in a certain way. What you tend to find is that the variation among the children is largely explained by the variation among the biological mothers: children who score high relative to the other children in the sample tend to have biological mothers that score high relative to the other biological mothers in the sample. Nothing like the same thing happens with adoptive mothers. *But that doesn't settle the issues that we care about*. Suppose the average adoptive mother score is a B, and the average biological mother score a C (adopters who aren't related tend to be well off, women who put their children up for adoption tend not to be able to afford to raise them, and socio-economic status correlates with academic achievement). What you tend to find in these studies is that the children will average a B. So even though the variation among the children is best explained by variation among the biological mothers, their overall academic performance as a cohort is best explained by the academic performance of their adoptive mothers.)",0,0,0,0,1.0

If you enclose the whole thing and shape the fans so that the air blowing past the 'output' fan gets recycled into the 'input' fan, you get a much more efficient system - the air doesn't have to come to a stop and so the energy of its motion can be reused. This is the physics behind the torque converter.

4.0,"[The Matrix] How is every Zion called Zion?[SEP]There a theory that Zion is actually in the Matrix and that the Matrix as we know it... Is actually a Matrix within a Matrix. It allows for the illusion of control (humans leaving the Matrix) without actually having to leave the Matrix. It also explains why Neo is able to control/destroy Sentinels wirelessly in the ""real world"". Additionally, the Architect specifically tells Neo that he must take people and rebuild ""Zion"", so, if he gives every 'The One' this same spiel, then it implies that the city has always been named Zion and that the current 'The One' just continues this naming. ""Zion"" is a biblical word. It means 'the promised land' and if you consider the Matrix Within a Matrix theory, then it dovetails nicely that this is all part of a system of control: The machines build a 2 layer Matrix and give humans the option to ""escape"" layer 2 to go to ""the promised land"" which is really in Layer 1, hence they never actually leave the *real* Matrix at all.",0,0,0,1.0,0
5.0,"Is any of you a real hardline gardener/pantser?[SEP]I'm 95% a pantser. The first draft of my first novel was written in 23 days. 28 chapters and 90,000 words. I went full tilt when I wrote it. Now, it's important to note that I had a strong sense of the main character before I even started. I wrote down some bullet point notes, character names, name of the city, setting, and that's about it. From there, I set out a small goal for my character. Step 1 (chapter 1) start his first day as a detective. That was it. I had absolutely no idea where the story was going. I just knew what the first step was. From that first chapter and the events that unfolded within, I figured out the next chapter, and then the next, and the next. What really helped me to stay focused throughout the entire writing process was thematically appropriate background music. I listened to Jazz Noir. My novel series is based on a detective in a noir-ish era fantasy city. That music kept my head in the theme and in the story. I just finished writing book 2 and it's currently going through beta readers. That book was also written with that same music in my ears. Seeing as how I've gone and turned myself into a mystery / crime novelist, I have now set out the goal of building each novel around a case. I still have no idea how I'm going to present that case or crime, but I at least have a vague idea of what needs to be solved. Hope this helps?",0,0,0,0,1.0

We still text each other plenty, give each other advice, and hang out from time to time. One reason why its a good thing is we know each other really well and aren't afraid to be completely honest with each other. We are definitely closer than some people ive known for longer because she ended up learning a lot more about me in that year and a half of dating. I forgot where I saw this, but somebody talked about how if you go straight to dating with somebody or start the friendship with a romantic interest, then its impossible to go back to being friends after dating because you never had friendship aspirations to begin with.

4.0,"What is required for someone to be able to use magic?[SEP]For the average person, it is just learning. It takes a lot of practice, you need to learn the incantations and the hand motions, but more importantly you need to train yourself to align your mind and spirit with the magic you’re attempting to do. This is why Dr. Strange struggled at first, he thought it was him just memorizing what to do and he figured he could master it because he’s a genius. The Ancient One shows him that he needs to get his mind frame shifted, which he does and then becomes a quick study. So the average person IS capable of learning magic, it’s just a difficult process that involves study and practice and personal spiritual development. There is one very distinct person capable of using magic without study and practice - a natural mutant who was using her abilities at a small level until they were awakened and amplified via exposure to the Mind Stone. She’s named in the Darkhold as the Scarlet Witch - a natural practitioner of chaos magic. This type of magic is not just learnable like the others. But if you’re an ordinary person who practices you could do the same type of magic as Dr. Strange or Agatha Harkness, they’re just better at it than normal people.",0,0,0,1.0,0

There are 36.014 million acres. So you're looking at over $272 billion just for the land alone (this is also assuming you trying to suddenly buy the whole state doesn't skyrocket the price of land). Additionally, you have all the businesses you'd have to buy, etc etc. So if you paid the entire state's gdp, you'd have to fork out an additional about $195 billion. Just between those 2, you're already at almost half a trillion dollars. But then you'd have to purchase all the homes from people, which could run you another few hundred billion dollars.

In fantasy - which I'm fairly new to - I like Robin Hobb &amp; her 3x trilogy Farseer/Tawny Man/Fitz &amp; The Fool \[9 books\]. There is a relationship in these books between the two main characters that is so interesting, ambiguous and complex that you can't wait to read the next intense conversation between them. Perhaps actually because there are no bedroom scenes , there is an intensification of the interaction. There are lots of sweet moments scattered through the books \[somewhat thinly but that makes them all the more impactful\].

What does ""nice"" mean? Can you get more nuanced? For instance if she is kind and giving, is she also considerate and remember everyone's birthday every single time? If she has every possible positive quality, maybe you can pare it down so she is laudable but not complete. Some people are honest but harsh. Some people are loving but not thoughtful (won't think to help until asked to). Maybe you can add some shades here to get more mileage out of being nice. She could save a cat. If you're unaware this is a term from screenwriter Blake Snyder about how to remedy unlikable characters - perhaps so that you stick with them long enough for them to do their arc and become likeable.

4.0,"ELI5: forgive my ignorance but why aren’t all airplanes equipped with parachute or something to slow their decent if something fails?[SEP]A parachute large enough to ""safely"" decelerate a plane would be extremely cumbersome to install, maintain, and carry. Many times when things go wrong with the plane, it can still glide. Catastrophic plane crashes are usually in situations where a parachute won't help either. If a plane loses engines a few seconds after takeoff, there's not enough altitude for the parachute to deploy before the plane hits the ground again. If the plane loses control when landing, it's the same problem. Instrumentation errors means that the pilots don't know they're flying into a mountain/the ocean, so they wouldn't think to deploy the parachutes anyway. A parachute is only really useful if the plane has a catastrophic, structural failure, like a wing falling off. These kinds of things are much less common than other failures, because the strength/structure of the wing is (relatively) simple matter, compared to the control and power systems of the plane and pilot training.",0,0,0,1.0,0

We met up with a group of other nerds who also had to scrounge up dates and had dinner at the big fancy house of the class president, also a dateless nerd. Then the limo the class president had hired got lost on the way to the dance and we didn't get there until midnight when it was all but over.

4.0,"What did de Saussure mean when he said, ""In a language there are only differences, without positive terms?"" And what did Christopher Ricks mean when he answered (paraphrased), you can't just have difference, you have to have difference *between* things?[SEP]As for de Saussure: in language, first off, there is no essential and necessary correspondence between any given signified and any given signifier. Nothing about the word “cat” forces us to use it to refer to the thing that we use it to refer to. Hence, different languages have different words: Katze, neko etc. If there were a positive term of some kind, it would necessarily lead to a word being the same in all languages, as there would be something essential about that word, which makes it refer to this or that thing. This is, very obviously, not the case. Therefore, de Saussure argues that any word derives its meaning from what it is not, or rather from how it is places or used (and how it differs from other words) within a given language system. Your example here is not optimal, a better one would be something like this (I think this is the example that he uses himself in the course on general linguistics): what are the differences between a house, a hut, an abode and so on. These words take on their respective meanings through the fine differences between them but these differences only crystalize once you have multiple different words. I’m not sure what exactly you meant when you said that you felt de Saussure’s understanding to be very incomplete, but I hope this helps in some way. As for Ricks: never read him, thus I have nothing to say.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: What is the process of digitising old literature &amp; why are so many old books not?[SEP]I have some relevant experience here. I've been involved with digitizing documents for a 100+ year old society and I also personally collect rare and antique books. To start, digitizing something isn't trivial. A lot of times, to get the best scan without bankrupting the organization, the books need to be torn so the page can lay flat on the scanner. Clearly not ideal but good for content that has a lot of duplicates where destroying a copy doesn't matter. For more unique items you cannot destroy, someone needs to actually handle each page and make sure the scan worked without issues (i.e. no blurring, etc). This very manual process means the cost is significantly higher not just in labor but you might need a specialized scanner. For more unique and older items, many of them are required to be in a library or some other organization where you likely won't be allowed to bring in your equipment so scanning it is simply not going to be done. Many libraries in particular might not have the resources to digitize the content. I'm not sure what you consider ""old"" since some of my books are 500 years old but anything older than about 200+ years old requires delicate handling. This means that you cannot use any regular scanner. There are slanted scanners that basically allow you open the book partially while it scans properly but like the previous example of manual scanning, this is even more expensive and more time consuming since the books are likely going to be more fragile. When you get into 500+ year old books, you also have a danger of exposing the contents to the bright light that's associated with the scanner. This could damage some books. In addition, some old books can get wavy with time so scanning them would not be ideal and would require additional work. The older the book, the more fragile it is, and the more work you need to digitize it. In a place like South Africa, they might not have the equipment or the funds (and likely both) to afford such an expense. It's a real tragedy when unique works are lost.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"What is your creepy experience that turned out not to be so creepy in the end?[SEP]Here's mine: when I was 12, we just moved into a new large flat on the 5th floor. The flat was so large that I was basically in my own part of the flat with my own living room and everything, while my parents were in their part of the flat. The flat was on the 5th (top) floor. We moved during the winter and everything was fine until the summer came. During summer nights, I suddenly started hearing weird squishy walking noises coming from the living room (next to my room), you know like when someone with rubber sandals who just got out of the water with wet feet is walking around. For the first few seconds I was unsure of what I’m hearing, but after trying to listen more closely, I concluded that I really do hear someone walking around in wet footwear. The noise didn’t last very long, maybe around a minute, but would occur several times during the night. This started to become a more or less regular thing, I could hear it during most of the nights. During the day I was mostly outside (yay summer holidays!), so I wasn’t sure if it happened during the day. I mean, I did spend some time in the apartment during the day, but I was there for mostly like an hour or so (speaking just about my part of the flat - for breakfast, lunch and dinner I was in my parents’ part), so I couldn’t be sure. For the first few nights when I heard it, I was completely mortified and just decided to lay still in bed. After a few times, I gathered enough courage to go to the living room to see who is there, but of course no one was there. However, the squishy walking noises were still present, but now they were coming from my room! I returned to my room and again no one was there, but now the noises could be heard from the living room again. That night was the first night that I locked the doors to my room as I tried to sleep imagining some invisible wet-feet monster having a stroll around my apartment. The next morning I asked mom if she could sleep in my room for several nights, hoping that she might have some ideas on what the sound could be. She told me that I must be imagining things, but agreed to sleep in my room (I went and slept on the couch in my parents’ part of the apartment) for a couple of days. Well, the next morning’s breakfast conversation was really interesting, since my mom told me that I’m not imagining things because she too has heard the exactly same sounds like I described. She told me she didn’t sleep good that night and that she doesn’t want to sleep in my room anymore; I was completely terrified since I was now sure something paranormal was going on. I asked my mom if I can sleep on the couch in their part of the apartment permanently and at night we locked the door leading from my part of the apartment to my parents’ part so that the wet-feet monster can’t get through to me. Dad told us we were crazy, but still didn’t want to go and check it by himself. So more or less I got used to avoiding my part of the flat at night and I accepted that I would be sleeping on my parents’ couch for as long as we live in that apartment. This went on for like a month or so. One day, I was in my part of the apartment and I was looking through the tilt-opened window, when I suddenly heard the sound again. Squish squish. Squish squish. But this time I could also see where the sound was coming from – there was an old man casually walking in front of the building in flip-flops. To my utter disbelief, however, the noise didn’t sound like it’s coming from outside at all – it sounded like it’s coming from my living room. However, each squish was perfectly aligned with each step the old man took. When he got out the hearing range, the sound stopped. So, what me and my mom thought were some paranormal monsters actually turned out just to be people walking normally in front of the building in flip-flops. We never heard it during the winter because people don’t wear flip-flops in winter and during the day mostly no one was in my part of the flat over summer. We never thought to look out the window because the noise sounded like it’s coming right from the next room. The sound could be heard because I kept all the windows (both in my room and in the living room) tilt-opened all the time during the summer, but to this day (around 15 years have passed) I still don’t understand what in the acoustic fuck makes that noise sound like it’s coming from the living room instead from the outside. I still hear it regularly during summer nights. When people walk around in sneakers or in winter boots their walking noise sounds like it’s coming from the outside like it’s supposed to be.",0,0,0,0,1.0

After I take a look at the cover and maybe read some reviews for the book, I decide whether or not to purchase.

When I hear that a book series has a lot of installments it gets me excited to really immerse myself in a world with characters who will be around for a long time. I read in short bursts no matter how long the work is, and I get attached to characters, so this kind of reading works for me. Speaking of immersion, I love it when the author puts a lot of time and effort into creating immersive settings.

The light from the observers room is dim enough to be washed out by the reflections of the lit room thus all people see in the well lit room is there own reflections, meanwhile the light from the observed room greatly overpowers the reflection from the observers room, allowing for easy viewing. You can try this yourself if you have a window or a glass door near a light fixture. Wait until it's night, turn on the light and try to look out the window without leaning against it. Chances are you will see nothing but a reflection. Go outside and then look in. You'll be able to see everything in perfect detail. That's basically how ""One way glass"" works, it's all trickery of light and reflection.

A movie following the easiest premise in cinema starring two extremely funny women from SNL and two other women with box office appeal with a marketable franchise behind it that still turns out that shitty has to be a con, apparently. Watch the original ghostbusters, then watch almost anything besides the ghostbusters remake with either Kate McKinnon or Kristen Wiig, pretty much fucking great across the board. So the conspiracy is that the movie was designed to be bad to prevent further reboots as well as female lead remakes of movies that make no sense 30 years later.

5.0,"ELI5: How does pirating movies, shows, video games etc. work, and why can't creators/producers prevent it from happening?[SEP]**Duplicating and Sharing:** It works by duplicating the content of the film, album, video game or anything else through the use of recording or ripping software that is used to create a near identical copy of the original content as compared to the original source. It may be someone in a theater recording the film with a camera or it may be someone ripping a dvd or cd containing the desired film, video game or music then uploading the content through a file hosting service or a peer-to-peer service that can host the file for others to download. There are already measures of security set in place upon shipping the final product in the form a various copyright protections, but just like anything else no idea is ever perfect or complete. There is usually always a way around it and it’s only a matter of time before the vulnerability is taken advantage of if its a newer form of protection that hasn’t already been exploited. **Using Pirated Content:** Depending on what you’re aiming to pirate there are also various ways to actually play or emulate the content. Ranging from the easiest being pirated music and movies using iTunes or other media players that are usually integrated into our cell phones or computers, to some of the more difficult being emulation of video games through software developed to mirror the experience of the video game by taking advantage of the hardware found on your computer, cell phone, video game console, or anything that is at some point capable of running the software with anywhere from acceptable to near flawless performance. **Using Official Hardware to Play Content:** In many instances you may actually be able to run the files of the game using the native hardware found on the console itself, which may or may not require you to actually jailbreak or hack the firmware using a software exploit or by actually tearing apart the hardware and modifying it in some way. In some cases both, for example if anyone can remember the earlier PlayStation Portable models requiring that you modify the circuit board found in the battery to create a “Pandora Battery” so that the PSP would boot in service mode instead of the official software, but also required that you jailbroke the software by using the service mode to run files from the memory stick and taking advantage of the exploit. There’s also occasionally ways to burn the disk image of the game to a DVD or CD and playing the game on the actual console it came from. This can be done in different ways, but it really depends. **Security:** Developers and their hardware architects are always pushing the envelope to enhance their security so that these things aren’t possible, but no idea will ever be perfect. You can update an iPhone’s software as many times as you’d like, but in the end there will usually be a way to jailbreak the phone if enough time passes and developers responsible for the jailbreaks are persistent enough to express interest. There are always investments made to safeguard the product even after final production. Certain ways that app developers prevent people from pirating their services is to actually incorporate server-side security so that even if the app itself is exploited you can’t bypass the server-side protection that delivers the data from the service or subscription. With paid software there may be serial keys that are either bypassed using key generators or cracked versions of the executable used to run the application on your computer. Streaming platforms have also adopted DRM protection to ensure the exclusivity of their content and to prevent the content from ever leaving the servers themselves even when downloaded to your phone using the service which is done by encrypting and splitting all the downloaded content into potentially thousands of files containing the data that is being used to provide the source content found in the app and all split files being without a file extension at all. All-in-all there is no way to completely protect any product. There are DMCA takedowns all the time, but it never completely removes the pirated copies of the content from the internet. There is always going to be another vendor.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It has to be done at the appropriate distance so the the light have time to blink, gates closing etc. A device that detect trans is called a [Track\_circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit) The simple way is to have have isolated gaps in the rails so not electricity can pass along the rails.You then have a electrical circuit that with a connection to each rail and when the steel wheels of the train roll onto the track they create a short and you have a electrical current between the track. Now you have a signal that tells a train is on the track and you can activate the crossing So you use the two rails and the train wheels as a large eclectically switch. There is more advanced circuits that you use if it is a electrical train and the rails is used and one connector or if the system should handle trains with large speed difference so there is not unnecessary long blocking of the lines for slow trains.",0,0,0,0,1.0

To best describe what happens in a computer on a ELI5 way I think an analogy is in order. The tech savvy among you might cringe a bit, and yes it's not a perfect analogy. Let’s say you are a baker that makes cakes. You then get an order for a cake. You haven’t made this cake in a while, which means you need to order the ingredients (flour, sugar etc.). This can be compared to a program or data being loaded from the storage device (SSD/HDD), into the fast memory (RAM). This is a rather ""slow"" process compared to how fast computer processors has become. And this correlates perfectly with shipping being slow... The ingredients have now arrived, and you fetch the necessary ingredients of the shelves. This correlates with the processor fetching data from the fast storage (RAM), and this is pretty fast in both instances. You have all the ingredients and the recipe ready, so you start mixing the ingredients. The processor starts processing the calculations from the instruction set (code/recipe). The cake is all done so you send it to the one that placed the order, in computer term this might be your graphics card or RAM. If the same client wants another cake this will go really fast because you have all the data already loaded (ingredients pulled out). If, however the next order requires marzipan in addition you now have to order marzipan and get it shipped. Or maybe the workday is over (close the program), this is where computers is a bit different, it will then send the ingredients you got shipped back to your supplier. In other terms, get the data from the fast storage (RAM) and send it back to the slow storage (SSD/HDD) so it can be reused later.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"Just because a different path doesn’t mean I should be treated completely different right?[SEP]Going to a JC is a perfectly respectable choice. No everyone wants to do should go to a 4 year uni. Your parents are being draconian. Start with a plan. Tell them what you want to do and give them a plan for your future until the end of JC. They might understand and meet you. If they are being inflexible, then you can counter and set up a timeline with them to become more independent. For example, negotiating a flat rate for rides and room based on your pay for a year and using that until you save enough for a car or cooler heads prevail. However, if your situation allows it, you might be able to live with friends (or threaten to). Another idea is to get your sister on your side to advocate for you.

I volunteered for a veteran's crisis hotline for a little more than 3 years, and will be happy to talk you through getting yourself proper help tomorrow as well as listening to your concerns tonight. The important thing though is to recognize you need help, and you've done that! The first step in getting free of this space where hurting yourself seems like a good option is giving yourself credit when you get something ""right"" since most people who feel how you're feeling right now tend to feel despair over ""not being able to do anything right"" (which is an understandable feeling sometimes, but it's one we tend to over emphasize and beat ourselves up for unfairly).",0,0,0,0,1.0

""Infinite Absolute Negativity"": Irony in Socrates, Kierkegaard and Kafka Author(s): Reed Merrill Source: Comparative Literature Studies, Vol. 16, No. 3 (Sep., 1979), pp. 222-236. : “…Infinite absolute negativity fully expresses Kierkegaard's dialectic of opposites, and irony provides the mode of its presentation. To Hegel, infinite absolute negativity is the meeting of opposites - negatives merging with negatives - the result being evolution to new and higher levels of improvement in historical time. The term is meant to be positive and integrative; it describes the Hegelian moment, according to Emanuel Hirsch, ""in the dialectic of the Idea, the Idea which negates itself and through this negation emerges as the true affirmation."" For Hegel, irony was only a mechanical device serving positive ends. …”",0,0,0,0,1.0

It was around 230 in the morning and all the workers had left between 11:45-12:30, knowing this we looked at each other and split up in different directions to cover both sides as the only entrance to the production floor was in the middle of the the building. As we walked around we both heard talking in a low tone from 20 yards then a computer for the printer had started printing out labels while my coworker on the other side was saying that he heard the locks on the trailer doors softly knocking against the doors. We ended up meeting in the middle on the other side neither of us seen anyone and were slightly freaked out at the time. When we walked back to the front we asked our other co workers if and of the workers had came back through and they said nobody had came.

Problem was, I was in the middle of nowhere. There was a hill in front of me and I knew I would not be able to climb it without stopping and taking a dump first. There were no people around, just one house around 100-200 meters away, so I thought I'd stop and just go into the tall grass on the side of the road and do my thing there. So I went in, started looking for a place to do it, and almost got into it when I suddenly heard shouting. Then I see an old guy running towards me from the house, shouting in some language I don't understand, and looking angry. So I come back to the road, put the toilet paper away, try to talk to him - with no success at all, as he didn't speak any of the languages I spoke, and I didn't speak Croation/Bosnian. Then I sit back on my bike and start riding away. To my surprise, when I look back over my shoulders, I see him smiling and waving at me.

My manager told me ""it comes out of your wallet."" is there anything I can do?[SEP]You should ask about this on r/askhr or r/legaladvice. They cant charge you for stuff like that. If you did it like a bunch of times they could fire you and say you've given the wrong thing to customers on non-refundable items too many times and even then they cants charge you. Usually the only way they could charge you is if they found out you had intentionally scammed them out of money and they would have to go to court for that. Cost of doing business is occasionally having to give a refund due to human error. I also feel like the lady should have checked before opening the package. If i was in her shoes id probably just take it because id figure i didn't read it before i opened it. Its not necessarily her fault but you also cant charge employees to buy things (at retail cost no less. If hes charging 30 im sure hes only paying like 20 or less. Before the vape mail ban i used to by my carts online and most places offer heavy discounts if you buy more than say 5.

Her idea so I just went with it. We had a lovely 4 hour walk along the beach. During the last hour she changes the conversation and starts talking about a few key things; 1) Shes a fresher (I've still not realised she looks a little young for 24) and she quite fancied another fresher in her flat. Apparently she told him how she felt within 2 days and he laughed at her saying hes out of her league. So she came to tinder. 2) She'd only had one sexual relationship. Her former boss. Who was also married and had two kids. 3) She then revealed she was 18, turning 19 in 6 months. She sets her tinder bio to a higher age because she prefers older guys based on her (creepy) experience. So we finish the date there and she asks about a 2nd date. Now normally I'd say no in a heart beat because of the actual age gap. But given her preferences, I said we could try one more to see how it goes. I get back to my flat and a few hours later get a text from her cancelling the next date. She went back and told this fresher how much of a wonderful date she had and she was having another.

5.0,"ELI5: Why do lions show sexual dimorphism when other feline species just don't to the same degree?[SEP]Sexual dimorphism always has some evolutionary advantage due to natural selection. This ranges from something less noticeable like differences in size to something more obvious like coats, plumage, horns, etc. While all felids are genetically similar, each species has gone down its own evolutionary path based on factors such as climate, habitat, species that co-evolve, etc. This is true for all evolutionary traits in all species from insects/ birds/ mammals to trees and other plants. Even if an organism has a trait that is seemingly obsolete, then at the very least, that trait was once useful and is now just a residual characteristic. A more direct answer to your question: You may also take note that lions are the only felid that lives in groups, so the distinct mane of a male lion likely has more to do with their communal behavior (you can Google that, there’s quite a few theories)",0,0,0,0,1.0

Examples: Installing a new smoke detector in your house is important, but not extremely urgent (whether it is done in the next 5 minutes or the next 5 hours doesn’t make much difference) If your house is on fire, putting it out, or calling the fire brigade, is both important and urgent. If your house is on fire and the big football game is about to start on tv, sitting down to watch the start of the game may be urgent but it is not important. Deciding what colour the casing should be on your new smoke alarm is neither urgent nor important. “Urgent” implies someone is urging you to do something quickly.

Everyone has a different lemonade recipe that makes different tasting lemon-drinks, but most of us can still recognize that its lemonade. Every musical instrument has a different mixture of sounds that it makes when we play it, but in the end most of us hear the same note. Here's a little music theory: When we play a note on an instrument, we are trying to create a sound with a specific pitch. This target is called the fundamental tone (or first harmonic). But when we pluck a string or blow air through a chamber, we actually create a mixture of tones (called overtones or higher harmonics) that accompany the fundamental tone. Each instrument has a different mixture that it makes, causing the overall note we hear to sound different. We call this quality the sound's timbre. [Here's a video graphing the tones of different instruments playing the same C3 note.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAXK4QKJ1Q) See how even though the note played is the same, the overtones (number, size, shape of the peaks on the right) are different.

I can imagine how either of those characters would speak, so I ask myself what they would say in this situation, and how they would say it - clipped, direct, and seeing straight through everyone's bs. Eventually, I get a good feel for how my own characters would react, but these comparisons help me keep them in the personalities and speech patterns that I originally envisioned. If this is an area you really struggle with, it might be better to fix dialogue after you've finished the story, so you can focus solely on that.

And learning to control yourself is hard, very hard. If you get the urge to over-use something bad, realising that it's something bad is the first step. So when you realise that try to go and do something positive instead. Go for a walk, exercise or read a book. reading books on this topic are in general a great idea (or watch youtube videos from experts, but I would recommend reading a book).

5.0,"If ghosts can walk through walls, what keeps them from falling through floors?[SEP]I’d say it’s the ghosts perception of reality. He/she/it doesn’t fall though the floor because it doesn’t *believe* it will. It’s subconscious mind is still tied to the mortal/living world where it just “knew” that going through the floor was an “impossibility”, so, in the back of its brain, as long as that thought lingers, the subconscious is keeping it above ground. I would imagine going through walls is, at least to an extent, a *conscious* thought anyways, something the ghost has to think about and *willingly* do. As the ghost loses its perception of reality, or, loses its “grip” on the mortal coil, it’s get easier to do things like go through floors/walls/etc. And eventually… probably why ghosts fade away to nothingness, when they’ve completely lost all grips and connection to the mortal plain, there’s nothing left to hold them here, so they dissipate to nothingness. Or, maybe I entirely overthink such matters.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Loki’s invasion plan was to use the Space Stone to send the Chitauri in with their mothership on the other side of the galaxy. It was a freak series of events that led to Iron Man tossing a nuke at it. Without easy access to destroying their mothership, the Chitauri were easily capable of sweeping through Earth’s defenses.

So if you stand inside of a huge inflated basketball, you will feel no gravity from ut. The proof is calculus, but you can also imagine it as a version of two inverse-squares equalling each other, which is how Newton proved it. Now, if you imagine the earth as a bunch of concentric shells (like a jaw breaker with different flavors), it is clear that gravity goes down as you tunnel through the center of the earth/shells. There is a second part of the theorem that deals with outside of the gravity from outside of a shell or sphere, which is the intuitive gravity that you understand from planets.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: Why cant we retain all our memories and experiences as we get older?[SEP]It's not so much that we can't as it is that we don't have a need to. It has to do mainly with the way our brain stores memories in the first place. Over millions of years or biology developed a punishment/reward system to drive us to seek things that help us survive and avoid things that inhibit our survival. The positive or negative labeling of memories is a result of this system, and all memories are stored with some type of emotional association. When we are young many things we experience are new and exciting, and the emotional tags, either positive or negative, are also more intense and varied due to this novelty. As we grow older, however, individual events become less novel because they more often relate to previous experiences and are less likely to be stored in memory as they are less useful in terms of survival. This doesn't mean you are unable to remember things as you get older, as there are ways to train your brain to maintain neural plasticity as you age, but due to the fact that you're not experiencing as many new or intense things, especially not things necessary for survival, your brain has no need to expend the energy required to create long-term memories. Neurons are too costly to make and keep them for no reason.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"ELI5: Why are there many plants that can be grown in a greenhouse, but some, like ramps and truffles, that can only be grown in nature with conditions that can’t be mimicked in a greenhouse?[SEP]Truffles are the mushroom of a fungus that is symbiotic with the roots of certain trees (most notably oak and hazel). They take up to a decade to become established (and you have to grow the trees too). this obviously requires a rather large space and oak trees need temperature variation anyway so being in a greenhouse wouldn't really help in the first place. Truffles can be cultivated, and are cultivated, but they are cultivated in forests not greenhouses. Ramps (and wild ginseng) are slow growing specialists in forest understories. The bulb/root takes several years to mature and (in ginseng anyway) is considered more flavorful/powerful because it has matured slowly in the relatively harsh conditions of the wild. You could raise these in greenhouses but....first of all, like oak trees (and many other fruit trees and berry bushes) they are adapted to seasonal climates and need to be cold in the winter to mature properly. The whole point of a greenhouse is to keep things from getting cold, so there's not much point. You can grow them in a suitable patch of forest after sowing them there, but you have to wait for them to grow to maturity which takes up to a decade. Also farmed plants can lack the marketing power of wild ones (wild ginseng sells for much more)",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"How do I have fun writing by myself?[SEP]As an avid roleplayer, I've done a lot of ~collaborative writing~ in my time. I guess I'll chime in. I totally understand where you're coming from, because there tends to be an unpredictable aspect to not being in control of one (r more) characters in a scene. You can then bounce off the energy one another brings and when it's good, you and your writing partner are drumming up what feels like a really awesome story. However, alone you don't got that bouncing back and forth. You're the only one in charge of where the scene goes. When you're trying to write out an interaction it feels flat since you're in control of both sides. I've done both solo and collaborative writing. I would say my solo work is totally different than what I write with other people, it's kind of hard to replicate. What I can say is what I've found that helps that bounce is writing all my dialogue out first, maybe a few lines of action if needed to give a sketch of the scene. What could also help is try and write as if you are you and your writing partner. Write a block from one character's pov, actions, dialogue and then respond to it from the other character's. And then you can go through and fix things up, flesh things out, fix the POV to whatever format you're intending to complete the story in. Just an idea! I hope you figure out a way to enjoyably write solo. I understand how difficult it is when you're used to collaborating with someone else (I often called it 'junk food' writing since it can get so addictive but never really satisfied my own writing goals)",0,0,0,0,1.0

I have a husband whom I love and I am only interested in concentrating on my duties and don't need to be made to feel unsafe while I'm here"". That may sound cheesy, but honestly, nothing makes a man realize he's being a creep like telling him that he's making you feel unsafe. I've given this same advice to some of my female friends who have had to deal with a creeper before and it works every time. I think the problem is that if you give these kinds of guys an inch, they'll try to take a mile.

You are right that the results can have no meaningful impact on any real-world problem. But, this is common for math research. A lot of times, simply coming up with the definitive answer about some problem usually isn't useful itself, instead the impact is made by the mathematical tools and theories that are created along the way. A great example of this is [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem). Nobody really cared if it turned out to be true or not, since the theorem wasn't at all useful. Yet, people worked on the problem for centuries which resulted in the development of modern number theory which IS used to solve useful problems. For example, this research culminated in the proof of the [modularity theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) which has deep implications for modern math.",0,0,0,1.0,0
5.0,"Is it good to improve your character in and of itself, or is it good because of the consequences it produces?[SEP]I have a variety of philosophical thoughts on this, but how about if I start with the classic ""logotherapy"" approach of Viktor Frankl? He was in a sense more psychological or psychiatric, but at least in his most famous book he showed great attention to ethical issues. Anyway, he tried to find meaning with questions such as who might benefit from your own suffering or perceived failure. So here's a tentative answer for you: You don't need to change the world. Few people ever change the world beyond a small area, or a few friends and family. But in order for those few people to change the world, the laws of probability require lots of people to try and fail, and lots of people to want to do so but be unable to do so. So by building your character now, you're doing what people have always done to make positive change possible. And it's always possible that after some personal growth, or some transformation by future experience, you'll be the one to make something happen.

Asking them to give you a moment of their time and respect that you deserve. and just honestly and bluntly saying hey guys. this is the situation. Imagine if this happened to you and the guy who cheated with your wife showed up. I wouldn't do this to you. Furthermore I dont appreciate being told I'm overreacting when this is clearly affecting me negatively after the partner of 18 years betrayed me like this.

Most of the mainstream stuff is too tough to follow if you're not used to exercise though.

I tried it for some time but lost my rhythm after classes started. Still, I'd advise you to start easy with 1 or 2 days marked for exercising. Don't feel bad if you can't follow the videos perfectly, the people making them do that for a living and the goal is not to make you a perfect athlete but to help you stay motivated through a workout routine.

4.0,"What do you so when you feel like you're emotions are getting out of hand?[SEP]If you want a more clinical answer: Start paying attention to your body whenever you’re getting angry/you feel yourself getting frustrated; everybody has some kind of “tell” when they’re about to get angry (whether it be clenched fists, faster heartbeat, reddening of the face, confused thoughts, sweating, some mixture of those, etc.), find out what your body’s “tells” are, THEN you should be able to see the anger coming and take some steps to keep yourself in check. If you want MY answer: I never lash out on those who are uninvolved because, well.. they’re UNINVOLVED, lol, so that wouldn’t be fair or reasonable or logical, and those are core values to me, so I guess my body just knows not to break those core values. But generally when I’m angry, what I usually do is vent my frustrations the MOMENT I’m feeling frustrated (if I’m with people though, I mitigate it by just venting in my head, or I negate my venting and save it to vent over later, but) that way the frustration doesn’t build up and make my overall day shitty/cause me to lash out at someone.

I am not judging you at all, just curious. I am wondering if that might be contributing to the anxiety around leaving/creating more stress? Just a thought. In terms of how to move on, you just will. I have worked with children and vulnerable adults in a number of settings and whenever I move on, it feels really hard but it eases very quickly. Yes, you form attachments and good relationships with the adults and kids you work with but they are in the context of your work place. There isn't a place for them outwith that and that makes it easier to move on. You might feel a little down the days following the end but I can assure you that it will pass quickly as you move on to your new job and a new routine etc! I am sure you have been a great asset at this place of work and they will be sad you are leaving! But it sounds like you have made the right choice for yourself! Best of luck! 💓",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,": How do calculators find out the square root of a number?[SEP]Depends on the calculator, but here’s one approach, illustrated for square root of 100 1. Make a first estimate (eg half it, your calculator might make a better guess though) = 50. 2. Add that guess to your target divided by that guess, and halve. So (50 + 100/50) / 2 = 26. That’s your next estimate. 3. Continue until the difference between succeeding estimates is small (again depends on your device). 50 -&gt; 26 -&gt; 14.9 -&gt; 10.8 -&gt; 10.03 so it’s getting there very quickly.

5.0,"ELI5: Why do we have to sit relaxed with our eyes closed in order to sleep?[SEP]We don't. It is possible and even seems natural to some to sleep with their eyes open or in unusual positions (I am that person too, I like to fall asleep kinda kneeling with my head against the wall and eyes open, I just zone out to the land of dreams lol). But it's probably unhealthy somehow. Closing your eyes means seeing less light, and darkness stimulates the production of melatonine aka sleep hormone, which makes you tired, and, well, sleepy. Relaxing your body to sleep - I can explain it but can't word it good enough probably, as English is not my first language and I think in images. Animals have to feel safe to sleep. Ever had a cat fall asleep on your lap? Congratulations, the cat trusts you and believes that you are not dangerous. Same with people. Imagine just randomly taking a nap on a very crowdy street, or at some protests. Hardly possible, I guess. Feeling unsafe causes muscle tension and being ready to react. When you want to sleep, you look for a cozy place where you feel safe and you can turn off the reaction mode.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: How does a Blood Oxygen meter tell your blood 02 level without a sample or contact?[SEP]The quick version is that it uses a laser to measure what percentage of the hemoglobin in your blood is bound to oxygen and what's not. Depending on whether the hemoglobin is bound or not, it changes the way light is absorbed, and the device can use this data to give you a number. There are definitely some limitations. For example, technically the device is only seeing if your hemoglobin is bound to something (and assumes it's oxygen). If you have carbon monoxide poisoning, the CO will bind tightly to your hemoglobin, and the device will actually read 100%, even if it's way lower in reality. Or if you have really bad anemia (low hemoglobin), the device may not be able to accurately give a number and may give a lower number than reality.

4.0,"Where should I start when reading the philosophy of science?[SEP]You have a couple of options. First, you could try the ""Very Short Introduction: Philosophy of Sciecne"" book \[[on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Science-Very-Short-Introduction/dp/0192802836)\]. This is part of an entire series of similar books. While they aren't the most gripping reads, they are quite short. Each author writes differently, though they all attempt to write in plain english. Another option, which I also recommend, is Naomi Oreskes' ""Why Trust Science"" \[[on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Science-University-Center-Values/dp/0691212260/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=why+trust+science&amp;qid=1621258132&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1)\]. In the first half, Oreskes outlines a very brief history of the philosophy of science. In the latter half, she turns to outline a case for why the public should trust science, largely based on consensus. I find her work more sociological/historical than philosophical, but regardless, it can give an introduction to some of the main ideas. Its also well-written and enjoyable to read.",0,0,0,1.0,0

We took field trips to interesting places every week. We camped, and climbed mountains, and overall were taught to experience things like being blind for a day or experiencing what marshal law would be like if it were ever to be enacted. One week was all about having to learn how to be an adult by going through newspapers to find a job that we would qualify for, having a job interview that if we didn't convince them we were capable of, had to start over. Once we had a ""job"", we had to take a legit written driving test, and if we passed, took a behind the wheel test on the football field in off road go karts.

They thankfully haven't been that strict about turning on video, so I can just log in and keep it in the background while I do something else. Anyway, the reason why I've learned to enjoy this is that I usually have to take the highway to work, but on those staff meeting days, since I have to get up early anyway, I'll take the long way to work through local roads so I can just enjoy the drive and clear my mind and sometimes get breakfast while the meeting's going on.

And in a way they will be right: both characters are super warriors, brooding and have plot armour (to various degrees).

I'm not necessarily scared of a bigger guy trying to pick a fight with me (which has never happened because I get along with almost everyone), but I'm intimidated in the sense that often times they're a lot more sexually appealing to girls. I grew up in a family where height was extremely favored (I'm asian), and both my siblings grew up to be tall despite our parents being both on the short side. I was always expected to grow so much more with my father saying things like ""in just a few more years, you'll be so tall and big!"" Which never happened. It just worsens when almost every single one of my exes had a thing for tall guys. Like if we/they saw someone really tall, it'd just sorta be blurted out y'know? One of my exes even went as far as to tell me (after our breakup) about how they just dreamed of dating a tall man. So it's not like a ""I'm scared of tall guys"" thing for me.

Another bad one is my parents talking about a bunch of people who died from botulism because they left garlic bread out for a few hours and to this day I am really scared of eating any leftovers that I know have both oil and fresh garlic in them.

5.0,"So what exactly IS Yggdrasil?[SEP]So Yggdrasil is the name for the pathways that connect the nine realms that is easily traversable using the Bifrost, and navigable using the old Dark Magics. My speculation is that the branches of Yggdrasil were either artificially created, or somehow strengthened, by Odin when conquering what is now the nine realms. Either using the Space Stone or the Dark Magics. Odin stopped his conquests after the first Convergence event because he realised that his creation/strengthening of Yggdrasil to the nine realms meant that as they moved through space the branches of Yggdrasil moved with them and, once in a while, aligned to create the convergence event. He realised that he'd already connected too many realms to Yggdrasil and if he connected any more Convergence events would happen more often - and with greater intensity. That's why Odin stopped at Nine Realms. His sudden pacifism was borne not out of a sudden change of heart, but the realisation that his bloodthirst could give their enemies a chance to destroy Asgard. He didn't tell Hela this (or maybe he did and she just wouldn't reveal it to Thor/Loki) because he knew her bloodthirst would drive her conquer more regardless (""Just one more realm"", ""if they try to use the convergence to invade we'll bathe in their blood"" etc)",0,0,0,0,1.0

Most of the influential early sci-fi short stories, by Heinlein, Asimov, etc, were published in pulps, but since these were actually good stories, they are not considered ""pulpy"" these days. The same author might also have a fair amount of complete duds to their name (I'm looking at you, Heinlein). Looking through old scanned issues of *Amazing* or whatever will give you an occasional gem, and a whole lot of crap. The really pulpy stuff also has some elements to recommend it: authors were not afraid to cross genre lines (see: swashbuckling adventure tales and weird witchy powers among the ruins of Old Mars), and if nothing else they also had a simple, unsophisticated exuberance that's almost impossible to recreate now.

I never feel inspired to mow the garden, so I don't; what makes you want to write poetry if the inspiration never comes? It almost sounds like you want to want to write a poem, rather you just want to write a poem. Like you like the idea of writing a poem more than the writing. So start by examining your motivation. It's easy to make the mistake of thinking that your poetry Must Be Significant And Meaningful. That's rubbish. Write a poem about whatever you want. Next time you're tempted to tweet something, turn it into a four line poem or a haiku instead. Build that poetic discipline, exercise that poetic muscle. Read some of the modern poets like Brian Bilston, who will write a poem about catching a bus or talking to Siri. If they don't resonate, read other poets and work out what you want to say by finding poets who resonate with you. Once you know what you want to say, it will be easier to work out how (the poetic form).",0,0,0,1.0,0

If the price of a Fender Standard Electric Guitar goes up by 30% in a six month period and I've had my eye on one, I'd likely decide I don't need it. (Supply and demand, keeps the price from raising too quickly). But I can't decide that I don't need a gallon of gas or a loaf of bread if I'm trying to get to and from work and if I have a family to feed. I'm going to buy those things, no matter the price. But I will notice them. Not only that, but if my whole grocery bill increases by 10% over a few months and if my gas increases similarly and the same with other items I purchase, then I'm going to have to economize somewhere.

So there is the old abandon farm house near our home. On a website it said that you lose power to your devices when you go upstairs. Well both of us being skeptics went and bought new batteries for our flashlights. I had an LED pin light and my buddy had a big mag light. So we park and get to the house. We went in and my buddy went to the kitchen and was looking around. I went and found the stairs. As soon as I hit the landing of the 2nd floor my flashlight went out. I called for buddy as when he reached me the mag light went out. We tried to call or yell for a spirit but there wasn’t any energy in the house like when the lights went out. So we left and when we got back to my car our lights were fine.,0,0,0,1.0,0

This often translates to ambivalence, no eye contact, greeting, smile, or farewell, and a simple mechanical, emotionless transaction. While I understand it, it is slightly annoying.

5.0,"Am I right in interpreting Aristotle's ethics as egoistic?[SEP]I strongly disagree. tldr: From Aristotle’s point of view, the highest good is Eudaimonia. The English translation of eudaimonia is “happiness,” which incorrectly implies that eudaimonia is not just feeling happy or experiencing pleasure. Achieving eudaimonia is to fulfill our unique potential as human beings... Happiness, in this case, is not only about pleasure. It is the condition of flourishing as a human being. It is the only human good that is desirable for its own sake, and all other goods are desirable for the sake of achieving eudaimonia. Therefore, eudaimonia is an end in itself. That is what he means when he says “goods correspond to ends.” According to Aristotle, every living being has a unique function that distinguishes it from all other beings. He claims that a being’s highest good does not lie in just performing the function, but performing the function well and in order to function well, it has to perform in accordance with virtue. Aristotle identifies the human function as the soul’s activity that expresses reason. Therefore, the highest good for humans is the soul’s rational activity that expresses virtue. The highest good is not two things. It isn’t soul’s rational activity that expresses virtue AND Eudaimonia. Eudaimonia consists of fulfilling the human function.

4.0,"What things were contraband in your school but people snuck in anyway?[SEP]I went to a boarding school in the early 2000s. One of the things that was considered contraband was music in any form MP3, CDs, etc. They were so strict about this that they would actually root through our rooms and our computers to make sure we didn't have music. Buy my Junior and Senior year I had made friends with the right people including staff so that I could circumvent these rules. (For example my laptop was never checked but approved anyway.) I was also tipped off anytime they were doing a room search. During my senior year me and another kid were making bootleg CD copies for our friends right under everyone's nose.

4.0,ELI5: Why is 20/20 vision considered normal?[SEP]Optometrists will correct the vision as best as they can. But they can only correct some of the issues. The most common reason why people have worse then normal vision is that they are unable to focus at the distance they are looking at. Using glasses or contact lenses can adjust the focal point so you can get it back into focus but it will not improve the vision beyond that. Of course 20/20 is just the average vision people have and some people will be able to do better and some even worse.,0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"How can i write contradictory characters?[SEP]My thought is that you have a very good understanding the subtleties of characterization. What you are saying is absolutely perfect. People shift from hour to hour sometimes. The main heart of the novel (a well-written one) is how a person grapples with conflicts or emotions, of understanding, and of viewpoints of reality. The obstacle is overcome because of choices, often hard choices, so it must be a hard obstacle. -- Write what you want to write and don't listen to those other voices trying to control your writing because they are not doing it-- you are. Also-- characters who are totally consistent all the time are called wooden or shallow. Stories that have only wooden characters are called melodramas. They are puppet shows, not awesome writing. I don't think you should change a thing. Move on with the understanding you have now. Hopefully you are keeping up with good writing. Don't read cartoony things, read complicated character-driven novels. This is also a warning to not show your writing to other people too soon. They will try to dictate how you should write it.

5.0,"Why do you believe relationships don't last as long as they use to?[SEP]There are a number of compounding reasons. First, it's no longer socially unacceptable to get divorced. Even some people who consider themselves religiously devout are willing to get divorced nowadays. Second, there are way more options for romantic partners. It used to be the case that, due to very limited options for travel and communication, people tended to marry within their village/town/city. Since this is no longer the case, and since many people relocate to different cities or countries now, changing romantic partners is more common. Third, there exists in every culture a standard of beauty which most people, subconsciously or not, hold as the ideal within that culture, if not the world at large. If they feel their partner doesn't measure up, they're more likely to try looking elsewhere. While it has always been true that some people are more beautiful than others based on whatever criteria, in the past a person's beauty was less important in a relationship that what they provided in terms of income, dowry, lands and titles, etc.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Eli5, Why do the rpm in a manual transmission fall when changing gears?[SEP]The engine is connected to the transmission directly. The engine flywheel and the transmission input shaft spin at the same speed. In a manual transmission when you change gear the clutch disconnects the engine from the transmission then reconnects the engine to the transmission. This disconnection will result in engine speed falling if you don’t keep your foot on the accelerator. When you change the gear ratio the engine must lower its RPM to match the transmission speed for the wheel speed in the new longer gear ratio. Imagine if you will: an engine at 1000rpm in 1st gear with 1:1 gear ratio going 1 mile per hour. The transmission and the engine are both spinning 1000 rpm to go 1 mile per hour at the transmission output shaft. If I change gears to 2nd gear at 1:0.5 gear ratio the transmission outputshaft will now be going 500 rpm to move the car at 1 mile per hour. Thus I have to reduce my engine speed to 500rpm to maintain the 1:1 ration at the engine to transmission connection.",0,0,0,0,1.0

First, they lack initiative of their own. They need somebody who can actually think giving them orders. They can also only follow simple orders. You can’t really tell a servitor to provide covering fire while it’s squadmates move into flanking position. Finally, servitors are sort of like a sledgehammer, where a space marine is more like a Swiss Army knife. Sure you might make a stronger servitor for melee combat by smacking two chainswords onto its arms, or a better ranged servitor by mounting a heavy bolted to its chest, but it can’t drive a Rhino, or know when to tactically change weapons, or even when to advance without getting orders from the Admech running its platoon.

4.0,"ELI5: How do thermal mugs work to keep liquids hot for hours on end?[SEP]For the most part things change temperature when they touch other things. If you had a drink that was 70 degrees inside a room where the air was 70 degrees they would both just stay 70 degrees. If the drink was hotter than the air it would it would transfer its heat to the air and become cooler. If the drink was colder than the air, the air would transfer it's heat to the drink and the drink would become warmer. If you could suck all the air out of a room the drink would just stay the same temperature since nothing is taking it's heat away or adding to it (not entirely true). A lot of mugs actually have an inner wall and outer wall with a vacuum in-between to create this effect. Now obviously the inner wall is connected to the outer wall at some point to hold the mug together. Additionally things will radiate heat even if they're not coming into direct contact with anything.

Lossless audio isn’t compressed in this way, it retains all of the sound wave detail as it was originally recorded and mastered.

5.0,"how do you do show don't tell?[SEP]I've collected a few videos [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nyxelestia/wiki/screentopen#wiki_showing_over_telling) about this. I'd especially recommend [Rogue One vs. The Force Awakens — The Fault in Our Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsIQa7sH5_Y); despite being movies with no narrators, one of them still has a lot of ""telling"" about the main characters vs the other one ""showing"" us the main character. This comparison of two movies within the same franchise and time period is a good cinematic introduction to the concept of what ""showing"" and ""telling"" are. If you've got an Amazon account, I'd also recommend Sandra Gerth's ""Show, Don't Tell"", which is a free eBook on the Kindle app. Because it's free, it a little broad and barebones, but that also makes it a really good introduction to the concept and how one can work on their biggest ""telling"" weaknesses. Caveat: younger or newer writers tend to take guidelines, analysis, and suggestions as writing *rules* - ""X is bad and overdone, so don't ever do it and if you use it, your writing is bad"". As you do more research, it's easy to fall into the trap of ""I must never do this thing/use this word/write this structure"", but whatever it is, I guarantee you'll find popular contemporary authors and classics which do use it. These are exactly what I called them: guidelines (to give you a sense of direction whenever you feel lost about your writing), analysis (to help you figure out your strengths and weaknesses, lean into the former, and overcome the latter), and suggestions (ideas for what you can try if you can't think of anything on your own).",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"What common exercising mistake do people make?[SEP]1 tip to me that I see a lot of people do is that they stick to a routine and keep it, and let me clarify why I think it’s bad. They will set themselves to lift a certain amount and for a certain amount of sets/reps. Sure that’s good for week 1 but for the next push it by adding more weight or more sets/reps. People will continue to do the same workout every time and expect huge results. Your body is accustomed to the regular routine if you just do the same thing. When I was loosing weight I did the same thing for like a month and I burned some but then had no muscle growing, after that I increased my weights and sets/reps and the muscle kicks in. In my opinion if u trying to maintain then doing the same is perfect, but a lot of new people workout to change the way they look. HOPE THIS HELPS!☺️",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"Are my parents failing me?[SEP]Wow, it's horrible. Clothing has nothing to do with this, boundaries do not exist and you are treated like cattle, no privacy, nothing. I suppose you have to rebel, I know it sounds cliche, but some teenagers do it for a reason, you have a very good one. Set up basic boundaries you can hold, fight battles you can win, you tried rolling ovet and taking it - clearly didn't work. Apply double standarts, see which rules work both ways, and if they don't, call them out. Try winning ideological battles, and if they don't relent despite you proving a point, treat them as such, stubborn idiots. Keep a record of their bullshit, so if you're ever put on the spot you can lay it all out to a third party. Go to a school councelor, he's a grown up that is there to help, schedule visits, talk about it. Express your frustrations, this is a problem, your feelings are valid and you're no less of a human then they are. Act like it. Talk to friends about whatever, despite your parents listening, HOW ANNOYING THEY ARE AS HELLICOPTER PARENTS, HOW YOU CANT JACK OFF, I KNOW YOURE THERE MOM, GO AWAY! Anyway stacy is so hot right? WHAT MOM? YOU DON'T LIKE ME WANTING OTHER GIRLS? DO YOU ENVY OR WHAT? Don't be nice about it, push those walls they encased you in, make them work for it until it becomes more trouble than it's worth. Know there will be consequences, but not like you get what you want either way right? Prove to them that privacy is for both of your sakes, get caught jacking off, get caught talking shit, prove to them that it benefits both sides. Stalk around, when your patents are up to something in the bed, barge in with some bullshit excuse, and if they give you shit throw their dumbass reasoning back at them. Sell them that concept of privacy. Many more, but thats the fun of being a teen you're missing out on. Rebel against the system while the system is as basic as parents. You'll never be respected if you don't respect yourself and let people walk over you like that for free, parents or not. You'll never be treated as an adult when you act like a kid when treated like shit. Don't have to be a punk about it, you can be respectful in all of this, but respectful disagreement is not the same as quiet submission. Just rebel, don't put up with it. Don't take a beating for free even if you lose. Make them think twice, resist and exert your will, wishes and dreams upon the world. Vent out your anger, make them hear it. It will never happen if you keep it all inside. Release yourself from this, and allow yourself to be, you fon't need anyone elses permission for that. Keeping still and quiet only serves these chains that bind you. Honest communication is between two consenting adults, what you have here is nothing worth saving, your parents see you as inferior, they wouldn't dare do this to any other adult human being. But it's not only them that got deluded in all this, you let it happen. Good luck.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: Can you travel to a particular coordinate in space?[SEP]Theoretically, sure, but it's not quite the same. The surface of the Earth is 2-dimensional, but space is 3 dimensional, so you have to specify 3 coordinates, not just 2. On Earth, we use east/west and north/south, and that gives you a fixed location. In space, we project an imaginary sphere around the earth and use coordinates called declination which tells us the angle above or below the equator, and right ascension, which tells us the the angular distance measured eastward from the equator at the vernal equinox. Those 2 things only give you a direction, but space is 3 dimensional, so you need a 3rd coordinate as well: distance. If you give a right ascention, declination, and distance, you can give ""directions"" to any celestial object. It's also important to remember that everything in space is moving, and coordinates are only meaningful from a fixed point of reference, so depending on where you are and where you're going, you may need to choose different reference points. Also, space travel doesn't really work like that so it's not useful for that purpose. It's more more locating and tracking celestial objects, not as a means of navigation. We have other ways of navigating in space.",0,0,0,0,1.0

A parent's approval is really important that way. After that, you could try doing activities like going to the park w the younger sister or spending time w the brother and indulging in his hobbies You could also try taking them out for food or just ice cream in general lol. If you're free ,you could come over to their place like once or twice a week to spend time w them.

Obviously don't tell him about the other guy, just tell him you feel that some of the passion is missing and you need to figure out with him how to get it back. If you can rekindle the flame with your BF then the urges for other guys will disappear. This would be the healthy way to deal with the situation. If you decide to jump ship as soon as you find someone else more attractive then that cycle will never stop.

It doesn't matter what the opinion is as long as you can back it up with some evidence and articulate it well. For the multiple choice a lot of the supreme court cases do come up and it's hard to say which ones. Also keep in mind the general stuff like time management. I forget the details but if you have 2 hours to answer 100 multiple choice questions, 1 hour in you should be at or past question 50 so keep a general eye on that ever 15 minutes or so so you can at least look at and attempt all of them. Don't spend a while thinking about something you have no idea about just guess and make a note to go back later if you can. If it helps I didn't find it the most challenging AP exam although that definitely varies by the person, but if you know your stuff and ideally if you have a general background in politics meaning you're politically aware, you should be in great shape.

4.0,"ELI5: Why can't single-use plastics just be mixed together, melted down, and used to make any other plastic products?[SEP]Firstly plastic is not all a single chemical. There are thousands of different chemicals which can all be described as plastic. They all have different properties and do not work well when mixed together. It is hard to sort plastic as well since while they have different properties these are not easy to distinguish. There are some expensive big robots which use a number of different techniques to sort plastics but these are not common as they can be quite expensive investments. Another huge problem with sorting plastic is that most single use plastic products are composed of multiple different types of plastic and even other materials. It is very hard to seperate these materials from each other to sort them individually. Just imagine a plastic bottle which have a different type of platic for its cap and then the label is made up of yet another type of plastic with a forth type of plastic used for the printing on the label. And then yet another material is used to glue the label onto the bottle. That makes it almost impossible to recycle the bottle. And it is not just different types of plastic but you see a lot of packages combining metal foil, plastic and paper to get the properties they want. And you do not want metal foil or paper in your plastic that you want to recycle. You might just bearly accept the color pigments that is in the plastic as it is. And then another issue is that some plastics can not actually be melted down and recycled. Their melting temperature is higher then their self-combustion temperature. So even if you put it in a vaccuum and heat it up you will just end up with charcoal instead of molten plastic. The way these plastic products are made in the first place is through chemical reactions for exapmple by mixing two compounts together which will harden into plastic or by heating up a compound, sumbiting it to UV radiation or just give it a nucleation point. Even those plastics that can be remelted will often degrade a bit every time you do this so recycled plastic have a worse quality then freshly made plastic.",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"ELI5: How is Universal Income supposed to work?[SEP]The idea is that everyone especially the richest people pay a bit more taxes and everyone gets a flat monthly income. For the poorest of the poor this is a net benefit, the richer people are the less they benefit from it. At some income level what you pay more in taxes equals what you get from the basic income and nothing changes for you. For the really rich high income the extra taxes far outweigh what the tiny monthly check they get. But it doesn't stop there. Because if people's basic needs are met they will be less willing to engage in shit jobs, wages for the lowest paying jobs will rise. This will trickle up to the ones with better paying jobs. (we are seeing some of that right now.) There is also the fact that the economy as a whole will grow. Poor people spend money. A rich guy will not spend all his monthly income. There will be savings and investments and other stuff. A poor person will rarely have money left over at the end of the month. By redistributing money from the rich to the poor you will put more money into the hands of people who by and large will immediately spend it on stuff. This creates demand and puts money more directly into the economy than investing in stocks or an account in panama would. Of course some special products will increase in price. anything where supply is inelastic but demand will rise if more people have a few dollars more in hand. This is not a whole lot. Almost anything with truly inelastic supply is already quite expensive. The one thing that is cheap and where you can't create more of it easily is labor. Labor cost for the lowest paid jobs will rise, but that is a feature not a bug.",0,0,0,1.0,0

These helps me keep writing where I'm at, comfortable that I've made the note and will not forget the idea later. I'll also fill in new bullet points for scenes I have just written, summing up the important aspects of them. So by the time my rough draft is done, so is my outline. Then I can use that outline with my rough draft for the second draft. Which for me, is mostly checking for continuity, and story flow. Making sure events that serve the same purpose aren't repeating themselves, and being able to reorganize the story as needed at a glance. My outlines start out very skeletal, then get fleshed out as I write. So, you'd be awkwardly standing next to me for weeks or months.",0,0,0,1.0,0

How would Marx himself have responded?[SEP]My impression is that Marx’s own answer would depend on when it was asked. The early Marx was more prone to a more unilinear teleology. But the late Marx of the 1870’s and 80’s would have answered differently. When asked about the possibility of revolution among the Russian agrarian communes by Vasulich, he stressed that the historical inevitability he mentioned in Capital was limited to Western Europe, and he answered that: “The analysis in Capital therefore provides no reasons-either for or against the vitality of the Russian Commune. But the special study I have made of it, including a search for original source-material, has convinced me that the commune is the fulcrum for social regeneration in Russia.” And in another letter in 1877 on whether or not Russia needed to undergo capitalist development like Western Europe before revolution could occur: “To conclude, as I am not fond of leaving “something to be guessed,” I will come straight to the point. In order that I might be qualified to estimate the economic development in Russia to-day, I learnt Russian and then for many years studied the official publications and others bearing on this subject. I have arrived at this conclusion: If Russia continues to pursue the path she has followed since 1861, she will lose the finest chance ever offered by history to a nation, in order to undergo all the fatal vicissitudes of the capitalist regime.” https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/zasulich/reply.htm https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/11/russia.htm",0,0,0,1.0,0

Rapid hyperinflation. Because you can't just print money with no value of production backing it. When you just print ""free money"" and give it out, it completely fucks up the economy. When you print billions or trillions of fiat currency, the value of all total currency goes down. If UBI was instituted, the problem is that every single company also sees this. Every company will just naturally say ""Prices just went way up! Don't worry folks, you can still afford it, use your free money!"" But the problem is that every company, every landlord, etc... Everyone raises prices. So the purchasing power of everyone actually will go down and Cost of Living outstrips UBI. The idea of UBI just doesn't make any logical financial sense. Not in our current economy that is based on human labor. The only way I see it working is in the future when we have robots and AI do all the work and labor and production. At that point, humans don't need to work or produce, so we can change our entire economy and value system to adjust for that....",0,0,0,0,1.0

And I have a problem with sweat my parents think I make up(forget to apply deodorant or wet my shirt in the sink) Later my mom found it hilarious I wanted to kite surf and climb. Hike. When I was in 9th grade I made something with my knee so every step hurted. Took me more than 3 years to convince my mother I needed help.

It's still a standing joke my parents bring up. ""Do you remember that time OP wanted to try climbing?"" They just laugh and laugh. It really Hurts. This make it hard for me to train in public.

Really hard to bike then. The lump of fat you have in your knee, mine was too big for fit do it got in between the bones and got stuck.

It feels like a veil just slightly lifting, enough to see I've been here before and I'll be here again, but seen though a haze from vantage outside of everything, and I get that 'oh God' in the gut as I realize all over again that I'm already damned.

Surtur there's not direct evidence, but I think he *might* be able to resist the effects of a Stone on the sole condition that he has been exposed to the Eternal Flame and is in the middle of destroying Asgard, Ego claims to be a Celestial, and we've seen that another Celestial (Eson the Searcher) needed a staff to keep the Power Stone in as a proxy device.

4.0,"What is bad about Socialism and Communism?[SEP]Depends on what you define as socialism and communism. Communism in its original definition is a classless, stateless, moneyless society where property is owned collectively and everyone does what he can and gets what he needs. In other words, there is no real downside to communism or it wouldn't be real communism. Socialism is basically a transition between capitalism and communism where a state has control over all the property, but is otherwise the same as communism. Both socialism and communism are democratic. The bad thing here is the existence of a state as a transition to communism . Other forms that have been called socialist or communist like china, ussr or north korea are usually autocratic and lack democracy. Also it is not classless as there is a party elite and they were all in only one state. Those systems are what unknowing people refer to as communism, and bad sides include famines, resource scarcity, lack of motivation and violations of human rights.",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"eli5 : How did we measure the distance between the sun and the earth?[SEP]The ancient Greeks were the first to measure the distance, and the way they did it was very clever. First, Eratosthenes measured the size of the Earth, which you may have learned about in middle/high school. He knew that on a certain day, the sun would be directly overhead in Egypt... and in Greece he could measure the length of a shadow when the sun was at its highest point. He then used the length of the shadow along with the distance between Egypt and Greece to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Next, the Greek's figured out the size of the moon. They did this during a lunar eclipse, when the Earth cast its shadow on the moon. By measuring the size of Earth's shadow, they could determine the size of the moon. And if you know how big the moon is, and how big it appears, you can calculate how far away it is. The final step is to calculate the distance to the sun. On a perfect half-moon, the Earth, Moon, and Sun form a right triangle (with the 90 degree angle at the half-moon). Now, since you know the distance from the Earth to the moon, you can measure the angle between the sun and the moon, and use a little SOHCAHTOA to calculate the distance from the Earth to the sun. Sadly, this method is not super accurate, but it does give some sort of answer.",0,0,0,1.0,0

They came in minutes after we did. It's only my birthday friend Kayla, and our other 3 friends. So we are ordering our food, and we ask for drinks. The family that came in, was to the right of us.

4.0,"ELI5 : Are ""more GB old graphic cards"" better than ""less GB new graphic cards"" ?[SEP]Very broadly the amount of VRAM - the GB - a card has will limit the maximum resolution of the textures in the game. This usually goes up with the resolution of your output. So if you have a 4K screen, those GB become more important. If you have a 1080p (or lower) screen, it's less useful. Of course, higher resolution textures and output resolution don't come for free, so it's possible you might find a game that's sufficiently demanding that whilst you have loads of GB of VRAM, the card isn't powerful enough to actually run it at a high frame rate at high resolution. Conversely you might find another game where the primary demand is the VRAM, which acts as a ceiling before your graphics card processor is even breaking a sweat. So the answer isn't clear cut. However generally speaking - and this really is general - each generational jump (ie 1070 -&gt; 2070 -&gt; 3070) will see the last two digits deliver roughly similar performance to the model above it previously. So 1080 = 2070 = 3060 and so on. But this is very much just a rule of thumb, there are plenty of exceptions and certain bottlenecks (like VRAM) will make the actual performance vary from game to game. The short answer, though, is that the 3060 will be better than the 1070. You may notice the loss of 2GB if you're doing something with very high resolutions, but a 1070 is going to struggle to provide you with decent frame rates at high resolutions on a modern game anyway, so it's not really worth worrying about.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Smol voices are, as a matter of physics, higher-pitched than bigfolk voices. And humans have some amount of ""mirror what the person I'm talking to is sounding like, and doing"" also evolved into their brains, as the mirror neurons that let us realize other people are people, and understand what their expressions and actions might mean, leak through into our own actions. So when you're talking to a baby, the high-pitched is coming, in part, because the baby itself is high-pitched compared to older folk. Happens with children too, though not to such an extent, especially with that syrupy sweet ""fake"" voice some adults condescend to them with. Ditto puppies and kittens vs cats &amp; dogs.

Certain parts of the brain are more active than others. There may even be certain chemicals that are more or less activated when compared to a brain without autism. That could explain why some people have very strong intellectual skills but lack social skills. The part of the brain that handles math problems, remember details, etc... could have a faster frequency speed &amp; lower amplitude measurements. And the opposite for the part of the brain that processes social skills. These are questions that researchers are still trying to explain.

I immediately went to work cleaning the yard up and growing grass, planting shrubs, etc. After some time, the yard really starts to come together nicely. Queue my neighbor stopping by to compliment just how well everything has grown! I was flattered but admitted that I had gotten lucky and the soil must have been primed with the right nutrients because it all grew so quickly with little effort on my part.... Well that's when the crazy started. My neighbor could not believe my dumb ass. She rolled her eyes and said ""the soil nutrients!? No no no, all the vegetation growing like it is has nothing to do with the soil nutrients! It's because of you and the crystals in the earth. You are a venusian. You vibrate at a higher frequency than ordinary humans, and your vibrations resonate with the crystals of the earth underneath your property. That's why your yard has grown like this."" I shit you not. I am NOT making this up. After I reiterated crystals with some obvious hesitatation and disbelief, this grown woman in her 40-50's looked at me and said ""What is Kalel's [Superman] fortress built out of!?"". To which I was completely nonplussed. This grown woman in her 40s to 50s had provided me with what she obviously felt was all the evidence I should ever need to understand her claim via somehow connecting the crystals in the earth to the fortress of solitude, Superman's secret base of operations. What's wildest is all the other stories I could tell ya about our conversations. This woman may be out there, but she has an insane amount knowledge regarding various languages, civilizations, science .... comic books and more. Where it gets truly fascinating is how wildly she connects her knowledge of these various topics for theories (facts from her perspective) about reality itself.

5.0,"Why do philosophers take common sense (so) seriously?[SEP]I don’t think philosophers think there’s any property of beliefs called ‘common sense’ that exists over and above plausibility. By ‘common sense’ a philosopher typically just wants to commend a view for being plausible. With that said, a lot of the time philosophers will talk about intuitions, and there’s a lot of debate about the role of intuition in philosophical methodology. One thing to be said is that lots of philosophers, Capellen and Williamson, for instance, do not think that intuition plays any particularly important or central role in philosophical theorising. Williamson, for instance, thinks that philosophy progresses more or less by developing better and better models (and by this he means mainly formal semantics.) Similarly, Jennifer Nado makes a very strong argument, in my opinion, against talk of intuitions as a monolithic group of cognitive processes that are equally reliable (published as ‘Why Intuition?’) Now, when you say that all scientific discoveries proved common sense to be misguided, I’m not entirely sure what you mean. No philosopher just works from a single intuition alone and builds a theory. Philosophers will consult intuitions at different stages of arguments alongside many other theoretical parameters (for instance, assessing the consequences of the theory, its empirical backing and so on). So to suggest that all scientific discoveries show that intuitions are misguided is a very naive view of how intuitions are consulted both in reflection and in everyday practice. A huge amount of natural science is deeply intuitive, except perhaps when we get down to the quantum scale. But the proofs and evidence that lead us to unintuitive consequences are themselves intuitive enough for us not to reject them for being absurd. I’m also not really sure what you mean by people creating common sense beliefs, as far as I’m concerned no one does this, especially not in philosophy. I do agree with the general point that intuitions cannot be used as raw data for a philosophical theory because we can’t just talk generically about the reliability of different peoples intuitions. However, how is this a problem for the philosopher, who does have common sense beliefs and is deeply reflective about them? Anyhow, if you just google intuitions and philosophy there’s a huge amount of literature on this (I recommend checking out SEP). There’s not really a philosophical consensus on the roles of intuitions so it is, to some extent something which is best to assess on a case by case basis when analysing arguments",0,0,0,0,1.0

So you might consider that maybe you're doing it right and haven't noticed. When I write in third-person, I only report the viewpoint character's thoughts and sensations when doing so is more interesting than narrating the scene externally. This varies enormously from scene to scene Also, I realized a while back that powerful moments tend to take people out of themselves: their inner monolog grinds to a halt and they have a period of pure experience. They process what happened later, after things have calmed down. Trying to combine the two in the same scene gives a strange sense of dissociation, as if the character can't really focus on events because their thoughts are so much more interesting.",0,0,0,1.0,0

More and more major studios are releasing unfinished games, as either ""Early Access"" or ""Beta"" or ""Games as a live service"". Some are releasing free games, others still charging full price for a broken game. Then they are locking content behind paywalls, adding battlepasses, adding loot boxes and other randomized gambling, adding ingame currency, etc. All of this to trick players into dumping more and more money into a subpar game.... It's really too bad. All the best games I've ever played are a single ""buy it and you own it, fully. No necessary microtransactions"" I don't mind paid DLC if they are legit expansions on an already long and awesome main game that was worth $60. I think this is a PERFECT compromise. Companies can get paid more for supporting the game and adding content, but players can choose to not partake. The problem here being that greedy companies are literally cutting content from the main game just to package as DLC. DLC should never feel like a necessary part of the main game. It should always be extra content, it should add stuff, but it shouldn't be critical to the narrative. Also, it seems like there is a longterm trend of major studios dropping story-driven games for multiplayer bullshit. This really pisses me off, because most multiplayer games have really shallow or shitty stories, and they are designed to be grinds. Fuck all that. I love my story driven games. The one company that I believe is still doing it right is Rockstar. Sure, they take a long time to release games, but all their games have insanely large single player games with awesome stories. Then they tack on an online element after to be the cash cow. And people can fully ignore the online entirely and still get their money's worth, and the online is just extra. Like GTA5 was well worth $60, it' was awesome. RDR2 is the GOAT of gaming, well worth it just for the story, and the online is just a bonus for those that want it. I just hope Rockstar continues this, instead of abandoning the single player games that made them famous for online only bullshit with shitty stories and nonsense.

Having the bare minimum is so much better than having nothing. I grew up poor AF but never really knew it because even though we were eating hotdogs and rice or spaghetti everyday I had something to eat when my friends didn’t. Hold on to hope and treat every day’s meal as a gift. Any kind of chicken casserole is dope in my book (boxed or made from scratch, frozen veggies are cheaper and healthier that canned stuff usually, eggs can feed you for any meal anytime, breakfast for dinner can be fun instead of necessary, try to plan out a menu for the week and do your shopping in one trip instead of multiple trips (this saves me hella money). Also water is really filling after a small meal and can keep you feeling satisfied for a lot longer so make sure you’re hydrating after eating! For fun we would go on walks, go to the park with pbj’s, go to the bookstore or library, walk around the mall with a tiny budget for an item or two, cloud watch, arts and crafts like making a collage with magazines and glue, make cooking a family affair, share and do self care things like grooming/laundry/nails/face care, cheap squirt guns are hours of fun from the dollar store, participate in community events like going to a farmers market (tasty samples), youth volunteers usually take parents for their programs and sometimes they even have snacks depending on the program.

5.0,"Eli5 What is meant by shorting a stock? How can somebody ""borrow"" shares?[SEP]Remember Wimpy, from Popeye, and his ""I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger to-day""? It's really a lot like that. Normally when you sell or buy stock, the exchange of money for stock happens at approx. the same time. Shorting stock is almost always referring to ""selling short"", which is, literally, ""I will give you this many stock shares at future time T, if you give me _now_ what they're worth now"". With the presumption that the price will go DOWN before T, so that you can buy that many shares just in time, paying less than you already got from selling them. This gets you in trouble if the price, instead, goes UP, and you don't already have enough shares to pass on ... and, since there's technically no limit on HOW high a stock's price can go, you may end up in REAL trouble if you find either that you now can't afford to buy enough shares ... or if there AREN'T enough shares available to buy, at any price, because others are holding on to theirs to see how high it'll go. ""Buying short"" and ""buying/selling long"" also exist, with appropriate differences between time money changes hands and time stocks transfer. But those three don't run the same risks, if you analyze them. --Dave, and computerized millisecond-timing stock-trading agents make this all GREATLY difficult for single unassisted people to make money off of, unless things happen that defy the predicting models, like the recent reddit/Gamestop foofaraw.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Not everyone will partake, and cigars can be extremely intimidating if you go into a tobacco shop not knowing what you want or would even possibly like. For those who don't often partake, I'd recommend an infused cigar, maybe something from Drew Estate like their Acid line. I love them and smoke them pretty often even outside of fun events like a bachelor party. Those are tasty and not too overpowering when it comes to the overall flavor of the smoke. Talk to the guy at the shop. He'll be able to recommend sticks based on the meal you're planning to have or the post-dinner drinks that might pair well. They're reasonably affordable, around $6-7 per stick where I am, easy to smoke and are damn cool. At some point, you'll probably find yourself just sitting around enjoying some cocktails, anyway.

5.0,ELI5: how are hot-air balloons navigated?[SEP]You need a good knowledge of meteorology so you can make observations and predict the way the winds travel at different altitudes. A lot of times wind might go around mountains and other terrain features or you might have different air layers with different winds so the air can move in different directions at different altitudes. An experienced balloon pilot will be able to predict these different winds or just experiment though them and find the right altitude where the winds take him where he needs to go. But if you are under the impression that a hot air balloon can travel in any direction the pilot wants you are mistaken. The level of control is enough to land it safely but in order to get where you are going you need to pay attention to the weather forecast beforehand and pick a take off spot carefully so that the wind actually take you there.

We were supposed to be cooking but you know how it goes when the teacher leaves you unsupervised for 3 seconds. Anyway, we're making farm noises. Not very quietly. When I decide it would be funny to make a really loud goat noise. Right as I let loose with a mighty full blown BAA-AAAA-AAAAAA, the gym quiets down AND the home ec teacher walks in. This mighty BAA-AAAA-AAAAAA just BOUNCED off the walls and echoed. Every head in the gym turned towards the kitchen. The doors at both ends of the gym opened and teachers stuck their head in.

4.0,"ELI5: what is the difference between the various ""moving"" pitches in baseball, i.e. the slider, the cutter, the curveball, and the breaking ball?[SEP]It’s the: movement, the break, and the speed. Let’s list them according to speed. A cutter traditionally is faster than a slider and a slider is traditionally faster than a curveball. So a hitter gets synced, used to, to the speed a pitcher is throwing the baseball. If the pitcher consistently throws the same speed, the hitter should have a better chance at hitting the ball in play. So the pitcher will vary the speed of their throws to “unsync” the hitter. Another thing the pitcher can do is throw different types of pitches to further “unsync” the hitter. This is where throwing a cutter, a slider, and a curveball come into practice. A curveball, does just that, it should curve as it is pitched from the pitcher to the hitter. This gives the hitter the impression that the ball is going to cross the batter’s box in the top left corner upon leaving the pitcher’s hand but it curves upon entering the box and enters the box outside the bottom right of the box, thus “unsyncing” the hitter. This dramatic shift from the pitcher’s release to where it lands in the box is known as the break. The overall change in direction is the movement of the ball. The slider does not break as much as the curve, and a curve can curve in many directions; where a slider is generally flatter but sometimes can be slightly vertical, but it can move just as much. The cutter generally does not break as much as the slider but like the other two it can move just much. Remember though, there are the varying speeds of the different types of pitches. So when all the different combinations of speed, movement, break, and pitch type are changed up it leaves the hitter guessing and that is why a hitter hitting 30% of the balls thrown at them is considered a great player!",0,0,0,1.0,0

I imagine that arguments that sex/gender distinctions don't work could succeed, but this does not mean that the argument will go in favour of Bogardus. I imagine the arguments that are likely to succeed are Butler influenced ideas that we can't really pull apart sex and gender, but this is because sex is also something that is socially constructed, as opposed to the 'normal argument' that sex is all nice and solid while gender is an ephemeral floating idea, or the argument that Bogardus makes that sex is all nice and solid and ties down gender.",0,0,1.0,0,0

The popularity of Twilight -- driven in particular by its protagonists -- has normalized a lot of harmful, toxic ideas about relationships for a lot of girls right at the age when they're trying to figure out both their hormones and their place in the world. These are characters who send a message that abuse is an expression of love, controlling behavior is protective, and unequal power dynamics in a relationship are romantic and desirable. These characters are dangerous not because of what they can do in-universe, but *the effect they have on the reader* and the underlying philosophy behind their characterization.

They will usually be either unable to hold down jobs at all, or will be limited to menial and low-skilled jobs.

What should I make of this?[SEP]At risk of sounding a little harsh here (please see it as tough love and not coming from a place of judgement): this is a problem on you and not on him. Everyone has a past. I understand and respect that some people don't, and obviously we all have varying degrees of past experiences. But it's not fair to hold his past experience/s over your relationship together. For instance, my current partner hasn't had as many LTRs as I have. It would ruffle my feathers a bit if he was to turn to me and say ""I can't believe you've had x number of serious relationships, I'm obviously nothing special"". Like, no, my past experiences are in the past for a reason. I don't want to be with them anymore, and never again. I want to be with him. I'm pretty damn certain your SO feels the same about you. Ultimately, however, you need to consider your options here, because this is going to eat away at you, I feel. Do you break up, knowing that you'll never be this one girl who he had what I'm assuming was a ONS with? Do you seek therapy and strive to focus on your own self-worth and not compare yourself to someone who is effectively a figment of your imagination (in that you can only theorise what she looks like, when you could actually be way off the mark)? Also you don't mention how long ago this was, was this a recent thing or was it years and years ago? Something I'm also confused about: you say that you have amazing chemistry, but then further down suggest that maybe the chemistry isn't the same for him.

Even if you put a lot of quirky personality traits into a character, they'll still come off as dull if who they are doesn't do anything to the story. With regards to personality traits, one common thing I see that tends to make characters more boring is over-balancing: sometimes you can just see that the writer's acting like character design is an RPG with point buy, where every strength has to be paid for in a flaw: and, more often than not, they use the same set of pairs. Kind but naïve, bookish but miserable at socializing, etc. In general, with personality quirks and traits, I'd say to focus on ones that affect how the character interacts with the plot: if all of your character's traits are tangential to it, those'll come off as boring because, well, those traits don't matter much. But, if what you know of the character are things that affect the story, who they are becomes way more influential.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Fossil is from Latin fossilis that mean ""obtain by digging"" so they have the same name because both are found in the ground not because the creation was related. Coal is was formed from trees in low-laying wetland, something similar to peat moss but with trees. 90% of the coal is from the Carboniferous and Permian periods, both are before the emergence of dinosaurs. Petroleum (Oil) was primary formed in the age of the dinosaurs but from zooplankton and algae in large shallow seas. The oxygen level in the was very low on the bottom or sediments cover stuff there faster then they could decompose. Dinosaurs lived on land. There was large sea reptiles back then but they are not dinosaurs. Because relative few dinosaurs would float out and settle on the sea bed very little oil is mad of dinosaurs.

4.0,"How do I increase my emotional intelligence?[SEP]Concur with the point about learning to listen to people. The more you understand what typically drives people's actions and decisions the more you're able to read it in the moment. Asking lots of questions in 1:1 conversations and trying to understand why people feel the way they do is also just great conversational style. Emotional intelligence also includes your own feelings, however. Journaling and meditation help here. When you sit with your thoughts and put them into words you'll see more clearly when something like that happens again. Most of the time we act on autopilot based off of emotions we're not consciously aware of. Journaling can help to unpack this because instead of just ""I was angry in that meeting"" you can get to ""I felt like i was being attacked because they didn't choose my idea."" This recognition will allow you to process your own emotions better next time because you know that you often take things personally or fear getting rejected etc. Sam Harris's Waking Up app is my favorite meditation tool, highly recommend!",0,0,0,1.0,0

Just like every other boyband over the past few decades (The Beatles, Backstreet Boys, One Direction), people, especially teenage girls, will go crazy for hot men. * Kpop groups in general provide a lot of more content for their fans when compared to Western artists. Hence, a lot of people tend to be captured by their personalities and the way they work well as a group. * They trained for years and have really good talent. Their three rappers are some of the best in Kpop, and they have great vocalists. Very good dancers as well. Plus, a lot of their songs are written by the members themselves, which is something their fans (Army's) appreciate. * They have some really good music. A lot of people my age are into it.

We don't know how to create it or destroy it, we just know how to transform it. As far as we can tell, this is a limitation of the physics of our universe, not a human/technology problem. So if we're getting energy out of a device it has to be coming \*from\* somewhere and the system you're talking about has no energy input and only a finite amount of energy stored in the magnetic fields. In the particular case of arrangements of permanent magnets, you can always setup an arrangement that applies a \*temporary\* force, but there will \*always\* be a position with no net force. The turbine will rotate until it reaches that point, then stop. That initial rotation is powered by energy in the magnetic field that you put there when you arranged the magnets.

4.0,"ELI5: Why does cornstarch or other grain slurries thicken sauces?[SEP]Starch is made up of long chains of glucose sugar molecules joined together, to form a huge string. There are actually two types of starch; amylose and amylopectin. In amylose, all the glucose molecules are joined together in one long line. Amylose is sleek and streamlined; the racing car of the starchy world. Amylopectin, however, isn’t so smooth. The glucose molecules attach to one another at different angles, producing shorter bulkier chains, with branches and bristles sticking out; more of a 4×4 than a racing vehicle. The most important thing about starch, though, is the way in which it reacts to heat. Starch from corn or wheat, or indeed any plant, is stored in the form of tiny solid granules, containing a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (the precise ratio depends on the plant). These granules are starch molecules packed together in a tight rigid structure. When mixed into cold water, the granules absorb a little bit of water, but not much; they are rigid, they don’t like outsiders, thank you very much. At this point, if you add too much water the granules simply clump together at the bottom of the pan, rejecting the water entirely. I think we’ve ALL been there. Lumpy gravy anyone? Gradually adding water distributes the granules throughout the liquid, but they’re still distinct granules just floating about in water, they don’t want to socialise, and they have no effect on the thickness of the liquid. When you add heat, though, you see changes. Gradually the water molecules gain energy from the heat; they start to jump around in excitement, leaping and bounding around the starch granules. Soon, this jumping and pouncing starts to affect the granules, the weaker sections start to break down, they want to play, and they start to think about interacting with all that energetic water. As soon as one region of the granule breaks down and interacts, this creates room for more water to be absorbed. The more water that the granule absorbs, the more strain it is under to give way and interact with the water. Starch molecules begin to leak out into the water, and flap around joyously. If they happen to bump into another starch molecule, they hold hands and skip together. More and more chains bump together, and hold hands; they start to form a meshy network of chains throughout the liquid, this is when your sauce starts to thicken.",0,0,0,1.0,0

It is by far the biggest, most complicated, ugly, down-right dangerous language you can use. But it does run fast. It takes at least twice as long to program in C++ as any other major language (except C). The men who program in C++ are Real Men. The women who program in C++ are Real Men too.

5.0,"ELI5: How do bots work?[SEP]Reddit has an API (Application Programming Interface) which is basically just a web page meant for software to read and interact with, rather than a human. In Reddit's case, it's a series of pages where a program can read comments or other information, then post their own comments, without having to deal with the fluff of the visual aspects. In the Shakespeare bot's case, it's basically asking Reddit every few seconds for ""all the posts in a specific set of subreddits,"" which reddit gives it. The program, which is running on its creator's computer, then does some processing to figure out which comments it wants to reply to and what it will say, and then uses the same API to reply directly to the original comment. However, in order to do this, the bot itself needs its own account, with its own credentials (username &amp; password). The bot sends this information along with the contents of its post so that Reddit knows what username to associate with the bot. This also gives Reddit the power to ban a bot as if it were a human, because to Reddit's servers, they're basically the same thing.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5: How does the human body figures out what is ""food"" and what is a ""liquid"", how does it sort it out?[SEP]Solid and liquid food/drink enter the body through the mouth and are chewed into a fairly smooth mixture there. From the mouth they pass down to the stomach, where a combination of acids, enzymes, and physical churning breaks the food down further, both chemically and physically. From the stomach, the food enters the small intestine. A bit of further chemical breakdown happens here, and nutrients are absorbed from the food into the blood through the walls of the intestine. From the small intestine the remaining unabsorbed and indigestible parts (fiber, seeds, etc), as well as the water enters the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs most of the water, passing it into the blood, and the remainder is passed out as feces. Meanwhile, your kidneys are filtering your blood to eliminate wastes produced by your cells and to maintain your blood at the right level of saltiness. As they filter, they excrete water filled with wastes and salt, which goes to the bladder for storage and is then excreted as urine. TL;DR...there's not a single step where everything gets sorted, it's more like an assembly line where different parts of the food get absorbed (or not) at different stages. And urine production happens off on a separate assembly line.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"What types of (modern formal) Logic are there?[SEP]A very complex question. Many of the distinctions that you asked about cut across each other---logic, it turns out, is complicated! The following is liable to be a bit confusing if you're just getting into the terminology, so feel free to follow up on anything that you don't get. **Propositional vs predicate** This is probably the oldest distinction. Roughly, propositional logic deals with full sentences. So, for instance, the following is valid argument in propositional logic: &gt; A &gt; A --&gt; B ------ &gt; B where A and B are both sentences like ""the moon is made of green cheese."" Predicate logic, by contrast, deals with objects and the properties of the them. So, for example, this is a valid argument in predicate logic: &gt; ∃xFx &gt; ∀y(Fy --&gt; Gy) ----- &gt; ∃xGx In English, those sentences say ""there is (∃) some x that has property F""; ""all objects (∀) that have property F have property G""; and ""therefore, there is some x that has property G."" In an average intro logic class, you'll usually start with propositional logic and then move onto ""first-order"" predicate logic. **First- vs higher-order logic** So what does first-order logic mean? Earlier, I used these symbols called ""quantifiers"" (∃x and ∀x) to represent ""some object"" and ""all objects."" You could also introduce quantifiers to talk about the properties too. So, you could develop a logic with quantifiers that worked like this: &gt; ∃F(Fa) &gt; ∀G(Ga --&gt; Gb) ----- &gt; ∃F(Fb) In English, those sentences say ""there is (∃) some property F such that a has the property F""; ""b has all properties (∀) that a has""; and ""therefore, there is some property F such that a has the property F."" A logic is called ""first-order"" if it only has quantifiers for objects, and ""second-order"" if it has quantifiers for the properties. It turns out that first-order logic has a lot of nice properties---""classical"" versions of first-order logic are mathematically simple in some very nice ways. In particular: everything that is true according to the axioms of logic is also provable by the logic, and vice-versa. And it turns out that the same thing isn't true for second-order logic, which makes it much harder to work with. In an intro class, you almost certainly won't study second-order logic; frankly, I've never really studied it, and I've taken something like half a dozen logic courses. **Classical vs. non-classical** Alright, so I mentioned classical and non-classical logics there, and said that the classical logics are simple. What's this distinction? I think it's fair to think of classical logic as the ""basic"" or ""standard"" logic. But it has some principles that people find perplexing. So, for example, the following is valid in classical logic: &gt; A ----- &gt; ~A --&gt; B Where ""~A"" means ""not A."" That seems weird! That means that the sentence ""if the moon is not made of green cheese, then I can fly"" is true according to classical logic. Similarly, it allows for double negation elimination: &gt; ~~A ------ &gt; A Some people think that two negations shouldn't always cancel each other out. The logics that people develop with different rules than these are called ""non-classical"" logics. The most famous of them are intuitionistic logic (changes the second rule), relevance logic (changes the first), and paraconsistent logic (changes a whole bunch of things). You almost certainly won't talk about these much in an intro course, but some of them are pretty cool and wacky. **Other types of logic** Finally, there are various types of logic that can be thought to differ in their subject area. So the basic logics discussed above really only deal with truth and falsity. You can add other topics, though, such as &gt; possibility and necessity (modal logic) &gt; future and past (temporal logic) &gt; permissibility and obligation (deontic logic) these are probably the three main ones, and they get very complex very fast. One reason why is that there are propositional, first-order predicate, second-order predicate, classical, and non-classical versions of modal logic *plus* a whole bunch of different versions of modal logic---as I said, the different categories cut across each other! You probably won't deal with these either in an intro class---but there are often dedicated classes on modal logic, because philosophers think it's really interesting. **Which of these are used in philosophy?** All of them, and probably more. But the main ones are classical propositional logic, first-order predicate logic, and a modal logic known as ""S5"" (roughly, the idea behind this modal logic is that everything that is possibly possible is possible---but you don't have to have that rule!). Others come up in much more specialized domains.",0,0,0,0,1.0

There's a bunch of things going on here, but a propeller is significantly more efficient than other ways of creating thrust. That's why wind turbines look like giant propellers. A turbine does not create thrust (""wind force"" in your question). But definition, a turbine takes energy \*out\* of a moving fluid. Things that make thrust are putting energy \*in\* to the fluid. We call those propellers or fans; there's no rigorous definition difference, although in aviation ""propeller"" means ""thing without a shroud"" and ""fan"" means ""thing with a shroud."" \*If\* you don't have a speed constraint, a propeller is the most efficient way to add energy to a fluid. That's why small aircraft, commercial turboprops, and boats all use propellers. They don't go fast enough to run into the speed problem. Commercial &amp; military jets, however, go so fast that the efficiency of propellers drops way off because they start getting near supersonic speeds. That's why they use fans instead. You have to be going a couple of hundred miles an hour, at least, before this becomes an issue. Since that ""never"" happens with wind turbines, they also don't have to deal with the speed issue and they use a design that looks a lot like propeller.

5.0,"ELI5: How does a turbocharger work in a car?[SEP]Both turbocharger and supercharger are trying to compress air to fit more in the cylinders so you can spray more gas in and get more power out of the same volume of engine. Supercharges are fed by a belt on the engine so they work at full capacity even at idle. Turbochargers are fed by the exhaust so they hurt a bit at idle and only really help at high RPMs A standard [turbocharger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Turbocharger.jpg/2560px-Turbocharger.jpg) is two axial flow turbines bolted together. For the hot side on the left, the hot exhaust is forced in around the edge of the fan which forces the fan to spin and the gas escapes through the middle on the axis(axial fan afterall) that the fan is spinning around. This fan is on the same shaft as one on the air intake that works the exact opposite by taking in air in the center and flinging it out to the sides. Now when the piston opens the intake valve the air rushes in because its at pressure instead of being pulled in by the piston alone. Superchargers come in a lot more varieties. Screw superchargers are basically two intertwined screws with a tiny gap between them. The threads on the screws grab the air and force it down between them into a higher pressure area. Superchargers are nice in that they give you boost at low revs which is good for performance, but also eat up a good chunk of horsepower which hurts fuel economy. Turbochargers extract wasted energy from the exhaust and use that instead of useful energy the pistons extracted so they can be used to improve the fuel economy of engines and let you use a much smaller engine for the same power/torque (see Ford EcoBoosts). Their main downside is not working across the power band but that has been resolved with a lot of modern designs that can move parts on the fly to change the turbo between a low resistance mode for efficient cruising and a high boost mode for high boost when needed",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,Why do some companies have 2 12 hour shifts instead of 3 8 hour shifts a day?[SEP]Shift changes are not free. Depending on the type of work you may need some time to prepare for each shift and then clean up afterwards. Even getting to and from the work station might take some time. You might need the workers on each shift to brief each other during a shift change. This means that shifts might be longer then the 12 or 8 hours intended for the shift or you might need to shut down production during the shift change. Even if the company manages to get away without any direct costs of the shift change employees might still not be happy with the frequent long commutes involved. With 3 8 hour shifts some of your workers will not be home until night and some of your workers will have to get to work early in the morning. And this can make workers disgruntled and they will be tired while working.,0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: How can spellcheck possibly work as well as it does?[SEP]It's all clever organization and a little bit of math. There's two things here: spellcheck and when things ""suggest"" words to you. Both are interesting, but you asked about spellcheck. ""Algorithm"" is a word we use for certain kinds of computer programs. There is one algorithm that tells us something interesting. Given two words like ""basketball"" and ""basekball"", it tells us the ""distance"" between them. That ""distance"" is how many letters we'd have to add, remove, or change to turn one string into the other. So if two words have a really short ""distance"" by this algorithm's reckoning, they're close. To make spellcheck really fast, a fancy data structure is used. One person mentioned a binary tree. This would be like putting the shortest ""M"" word on a pillar with two doors going left or right. If your word (""baskeball"") is ""less than"" that ""M"" word, you go left. That presents you with a ""G"" word, you go left again, and eventually you're looking at ""B"" words. Each time you make a choice, you cut out half the possible words. That's still pretty slow if we have the 170k or so commonly-used English words. We can do better. Now imagine you see 26 doors: one for each letter of the alphabet. Our word starts with ""B"" so we go in that door. In theory, we just cut 170k words down to 1/26 of that in one go, that's way better than half! Next we go in ""a"" because the word starts with ""ba"". By the time we walk through ""b-a-s-k-e"", we find out there isn't a door that has ""B"" on it. That means there are no words in the dictionary that start with ""baskeb"", and we only had to make 5 comparisons to try it. So the computer takes a step back and looks at all the words that start with ""b-a-s-k-e"", assuming that the 'b' is probably the typo. There are probably only maybe 20-30 words total that start with ""b-a-s-k-e"", so the computer calculates the ""distance"" between all of them and ""basekball"". Two candidates will have a very low distance: ""basketball"" and ""baseball"". So the spell checker is *pretty sure* one of those two is what you meant. And instead of having to check 170k words, it only performed about 40 total comparisons and maybe spent 1,000 operations on the distance calculations. 1,040 things is much faster than 170,000 things. Sometimes a lot of words have a low score. In that case it usually just guesses. Sometimes the dictionary data has extra data with each word that's a kind of ""popularity score"". There could be some really obscure word that nobody ever uses like ""basekebab"" that's really close to your word as well, but if it has a very bad popularity score the spell checker might ignore it unless it's the ONLY option. How does that popularity score get calculated? It's sort of magic, but also pretty obvious. The people who write the spell checker get a bunch of digital books and run them through a program that counts each time a word is used. The more often a word is used, the more popular it must be! Obviously this gets really influenced by what books are chosen, so different algorithms can make different suggestions. In fact, that's mostly how auto-suggest works too. That data structure with the ""doors"" is used to find the ""close"" words to what you typed, then popularity data is used to guess which of the closest words are the most frequently used. A big difference is those tend to ""learn"" popularity. If you select a word, the ""popularity score"" changes to make it more popular. That way, if you use a lot of words that aren't common, eventually your computer learns to suggest those. Some of these algorithms are very smart and look at the whole sentence, so they learn ""this word usually comes after that word"". But the way words and numbers are stored to handle that is MUCH more complicated.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Eli5 Why does oil not evaporate like water?[SEP]In a way, it’s because if an oil does evaporate, we decide not to call it an oil. Oil molecules are mostly chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen stuck to them. A lot of oil molecules, like those in heating fuel oil or lubricating oil, are long chains. Because they are long it takes a lot of energy to get them to leave their liquid state and fly around like a gas. There are smaller chains of carbon: pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane, for example, are found in gasoline. They are fairly small, but fundamentally no different from the larger molecules in what we call oil. Because they are smaller, they do evaporate like water. We just choose not to call gasoline “oil”. You can go even smaller. Methane, ethane, propane, and butane are even smaller chains, again fundamentally the same as oil. Because they are so small, are gases at room temperature - they have already evaporated before we get a chance to do anything. Again, we just choose to not call these things “oil”.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"ELI5: How come there isn't an imaginary system for dividing a number by 0, while there is one for taking the square root of a negative number?[SEP]Projective Geometry uses Homogeneous Cartesian Coordinates (HCC), which can be mapped with conventional coordinates by an additional ""scaling"" number at the end. So (3,5) would be (3,5,1) or (6,10,2) or (4.5, 7.5, 1.5), for example. But if you have (3,5,0) it refers to the point at infinity along the line from (0,0,1) and (3,5,1). The General Projective Transformation (GPT) is used to handle these coordinates. If you ""draw"" a line between any two points at infinity, they define the line at infinity, which goes through all the points at infinity. BTW, (3,5,0) refers to the single point at infinity in both ""directions."" Using an appropriate GPT, you can transform the point at infinity to become local, but another point, previously local, becomes inaccessible, i.e., at infinity. Because of the convenience of using HCC via the GPT, this has taken over computer graphics internally. I learned this at MIT in 1960 when our math was mostly done by hand. If you have 3D coordinates, (3,4,5) becomes (3,4,5,1) and so on.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Panicked, I pace the lobby floor. I run into my mom in the lobby so I'm relieved as *hell*, but she says she's not giving me her card 'cause she's going late night shopping. DAMN IT MOM! She disappears and I wander this hell looking for a flight of stairs I could *maybe* run 8 levels up, but no such luck. I get on an elevator with this family hoping they'd have the same floor as me so I could find my room and bang on my door. Unfortunately, they found me suspicious and left the elevator. I go back down to the lobby help desk to ask for a new card. Language barrier. But I get my card. I use it to get to the 8th floor thank GOD. But I forget my room number. I'm now wandering this maze of a floor looking through peep holes thinking that'll help. I feel more lost so I go back down to the lobby and ask this gentleman at the help desk that I forgot my room.

A zombie is a relatively easy foe to tangle with. It only wants one thing, to eat you. It has no reasoning capability, it's intentions are known immediately and it is incapable of doing much more than shambling about. Their only literal advantages against you is they do not tire or know fear. Another human being in a desperate situation where they're cold, hungry, tired and afraid? Now *that's* a fucking monster right there. Another human being can strategize, it can lie to you. It can mask its intentions until you let your guard down.

You would be making a mistake not to believe the conclusion, etc. Or, conversely, the argument gives you reason to give up belief in one of the premises, etc. The argument can't and won't force you to revise your beliefs, but something is going wrong when you don't. These are all normative notions. They are all derived norms in that they are cases where you get more specific guidance from the application of a more general norm (like trying to remain consistent).

The sum is to be determined by a later court hearing that will take into account the value of the cargo salvaged and the risk to the salvor.

Looking down I see I’m in a bed made for humans half my size; I start to notice all the toys on the floor; on the walls are pictures of an adorable little boy I’ve never seen. I woke up in a child’s bunk bed. **A fucking child’s bunk bed.** A *stranger* child’s fucking bunk bed! Utterly bewildered, half wanting to laugh &amp; half panicking that I could very well be the worst human on the planet, I kind of rolled/fell off the top bunk and bravely ventured down the hall, before I started to remember... my cousin and I came back to this guy’s house that she clicked with at the bar the night before. He was recently divorced so he didn’t have the kids that weekend (well except for us, arguably). The only thing that was better than what I saw when I first woke up was my cousin’s experience. She opened her eyes to a giant portrait hanging on his entire wall, directly across from his bed, of his two young kids. Staring right back at her, judging eyes and all. 😂 It was a lot for two twenty-somethings to take in first thing in the morning with a pounding headache.

When you sing (or play) ""a note"", the name of that note is just whatever the most prominent tone in your voice is. You're still producing a whole array of other sounds called ""overtones"" along with it. To me, those who have too many high-mid and high frequencies in their voices tend to sound harsh, especially when belting those REALLY high notes. Our ears are more sensitive to frequencies in this range, so that harshness is likely to be a turn-off in more cases when compared with singers who don't have as many of those overtones. Those who sound more balanced, with the right amount of clarity and warmth, often are the ""easiest"" on the ears. That's my theory anyway.",0,0,0,1.0,0

The entire session was basically the older workers brain storming cliche ass kissing phraises on what is expected of them as a worker, such as integrity, team work, leadership, honesty and what not. The manager then had those cliche words printed on a plastic boards and a kiss ass definition under those keywords and pinned it in our lunch room. &amp;#x200B; On my final week as an employee at that place, I pulled an all nighter (didn't do any work at all during that week, what are they going to do to me?!

We look for similarities and things to lock onto. We 'write what we know', sometimes without knowing that we do so. My wife has told me a couple times that some of my characters are a lot like certain aspects of me. While not a cookie-cutter copy of me, there are similarities. I work hard NOT to always do that, now. I will go through in post-edit and look for things that are TOO much like me or someone I know, and edit them a little to make it more vague. For example... I wrote a piece some time ago and when I sent it to a couple people for something like a peer review, one of them... a woman I dated many years ago, came back and told me, ""This is me!

5.0,"ELI5: How does an electric aircraft work?[SEP]A airliner do not use the exhaust from the combustion of the fuel as the main source of trust. A turbojet engines do that but that is not what is used today, the airliners today are High-bypass turbofan engines. It use the exhaust to drive a turbine that dive the fan on the front of the engine. The majority of the trust is from the air the fan push around the engine. The engine bypass ratios is the amount of air around relative to trough the engines. Efficient engine today is at around 10x air around vs through the engine. So the fan work like a propeller with lost of blades. Modern propeller engines are turboprop engines so a turbine just like a jet engine that drive a propeller. So a electric aircraft can replace the the fuel burning and turbine part with a electric motor. So you connect the fan or propeller to a electrical engine. That is exactly how model aircraft has worked for decades. I have no idea if that work at supersonic speed but that is quite irrelevant for airlines because of not them fly faster then the speed of sound. Concorde did but it is not in operation today.

This coincides with a move to *nix, then OS X. I’ve been noodling around with computers since I was a kid in the late 80s and early 90s. Built my first windows PC as an undergrad in the late 90s (UK, STEM) - would have been windows 98. We had a computer lab where we accessed email via pine - I checked it, oh, once a week? My box did not have an internet connection at first. About this time, I was introduced to Linux by some engineering friends, and BSD in the lab I was working in, where we were doing computational molecular modeling. When I hit grad school in 2001, I bought the first in a series of Dell laptops. My project evolved from experimental to computational, so I switched to Linux full time - first Debian, then Ubuntu around 2004? By this time I was pretty glued to a wired internet connection at work and had DSL service at home. I started using cluster computing, and my tools were perl, zsh, and R. Postdoc starting in 2006 - more cluster computing, built an Ubuntu box under my desk for some local heavy lifting, and a Lenovo thinkpad running ubuntu for everything else. Then around 2008 I got my first metal-body MacBook - I was tired of doing all the sysadmin for my boxes, and I wanted a plug and play solution that would also give me shells and native nix-like tools. Mac OS X seemed to fit the bill. Today, I still use a MacBook, though my work has shifted to mostly word processing I still write some code. I wrote some wdl stuff for a cluster run today, as a matter of fact. We are shifting over to cloud-based compute, but many of my old tools are still mainstays of my work: awk one liners, zsh, R, emacs and the rest. Plus ça change...",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5 what is the difference between LED, LCD, OLED, QLED, and plasma?[SEP]A lot of it is deliberately misleading branding from manufacturers, there are really only 2 main TV technologies right now (LCD &amp; OLED) * **LCD: Liquid crystal display**. The same technology used for the display in digital watches and alarm clocks, but miniaturised to the point where they can make up the pixels of a screen. The pixels don't produce their own light so they need a backlight. Old LCDs used CCFL backlights (flat fluorescent lamps) but since about 2010 they have used LED backlights. To market the newer backlight technology manufacturers commonly call these ""**LED TV**s"", even though they are just LCDs with a better backlight. **QLED** is Samsung branding for LCD TVs that have 'quantum dot' films inside them, it's a layer between the backlight and LCD layer that enables the tv to produce more colours with higher brightness. A problem with LCD is that when watching dark scenes some of the light from the backlight still bleeds through, making blacks look grey (especially at high brightness settings). Local dimming is a technology where the backlight is divided into sections that can individually be made lighter or darker, allowing an LCD screen to look better in dark scenes, **Mini LED** is the term for a perfect version of this local dimming technology where every pixel has it's own individual backlight, this is the newest LCD technology branding you will start seeing in 2021 TVs, but it's still LCD at it's core. * **OLED: Organic Light Emitting Diodes**. This is a totally different technology to LCD, the pixels themselves produce their own light so there's no backlight. This means there's no backlight bleeding through during dark scenes allowing inky blacks and amazing contrast. Also because there's no extra layers needed for the backlight, quantum dot layer, etc OLED TVs can be extremely thin. The downsides of OLED is that the pixels break down over time and static images can get burned in, also they tend not to be as bright as LCD screens. That said companies have been improving the technology every year making these problems less and less prevalent. * **Plasma** screens were an older technology which worked by having thousands of pockets of a gas that would turn into plasma and produce light when an electric field was put across them. It offered many of the same benefits as OLED since each pixel made it's own light, but it was costly to manufacture compared to LCD TVs, and then OLED came along offering all of the same picture quality benefits and made it truly obsolete. There is a new upcoming TV technology called 'Micro LED', which is a TV made up of millions of tiny LED lights. It has the same benefits as OLED but with the increased brightness and longevity of LCD TVs, so it's like a best of both.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"What financial information/advice do you wish you knew before entering academia?[SEP]This goes without saying, but do everything you can to stay out of debt. I'm namely talking about credit card debt. I couldn't really manage everything on my grad student salary, and slowly racked up a a hunk of credit card debt (~$16,000 over a few years, which also included some medical bills, I swear I wasn't being totally irresponsible). Sometime before I graduated I built my self a credit card calculator to figure out how/if/when I could ever pay this off. I realized I could pay it, with diligence, after I had a better salary. But, I didn't realize: A) That it's almost a miracle I landed a job with a decent salary in the first place. B) That I'd be really behind on saving for other important things like buying a house because much of my money is going to paying off debts. C) That once I finally took a long hard look at my retirement funds, that I'd have to pay in much more than most people to catch up-- despite actually paying something toward retirement the whole time, which many grad students don't even do. D) Just how much my monthly student loan bill would be ($970 a month, after re-financing) I'll get there, but it's going to take a while. Also-- Pay into your retirement account, even if it's only a little bit each month. As a Postdoc, I definitely wasn't able to buy a house, but never felt like that made sense anyway. A post-doc is a temporary position. Houses are only good investments if you can stay for several years. My partner and I only began to consider where and when to actually buy a house when I accepted my TT job. If you are a PhD student just starting out with the means to do so and in an area with a decent cost of living, that would be a decent time to buy a small house because you are likely to be in the same area for several years. I do know a few people who have done that and it worked well for them, but I feel like that's a really special circumstance and I suspect they had some family money. The best advice for grad students is probably to: ~Have roommates to split expenses ~Have a strict (and feasible) budget, that includes a savings, and stick to it. ~Watch how much money you spend on beers and going out. ~If you have student loans from undergrad, pay at least something against them while you are in school, even if you are not required to by the terms of y our loans.",0,0,0,1.0,0

They also have no nerves to the intercostal muscles to allow for coughing which makes them very prone to infection. These people may be dependent on ventilators for the rest of their lives. People do better with lower cervical spinal cord injuries and may have some use of their arms and the ability to cough and breathe. The heart will beat but is affected by spinal cord injuries. Cervical spinal cord injury patients are prone to low heart rates. Some of the controls for things like blood pressure are also damaged. Spinal injury patients typically have low blood pressure.

But the problem is that in at least 80% of videos, they don't actually finish rinsing the sponge. Like at the end there's still soap in it. And I always thought it was a universal thing to find it unsatisfying to see something left unfinished and incomplete. Like sometimes I've seen random YouTube videos that are supposed to be unsatisfying and they're always something being done unevenly or done partially and left incomplete. Like imagine you see a video of someone cleaning a window and they clean 90% of it but leave a dirty spot. That's unsatisfying and frustrating, right? Doesn't everyone feel that way? But apparently I'm the only one in the sponge rinsing community who cares if the sponges are fully rinsed, because in most videos they're not and those videos get just as many likes as the ones that actually finish rinsing and never have any dislikes. And just, how‽ I honestly find it frustrating and stressful when the rinse is left incomplete. And it actually angers me that nobody else cares at all, that even though you'd think it's universal to find it unsatisfying to see something just partially done and left unfinished and incomplete, nobody else cares. I mean the whole point of these ASMR videos is to be satisfying, they often have ""satisfying"" in the title, but it's exact opposite of satisfying to leave something incomplete! How does no one else see that‽ So since no one besides me cares, the people who make the videos don't bother to make sure the sponges are fully rinsed. Sometimes they will be, but in most videos they're not. And I really, really love the sponge rinsing ASMR videos where the sponges actually are fully rinsed, but I have to search through so many unsatisfying, frustrating videos where the rinse is only partially done in order to find them. It seriously makes me mad that I'm the only one who cares whether the rinse is actually finished or if the person just does a half assed job and only partially rinses the sponge and leaves soap in it at the end.",0,0,0,1.0,0

The only thing you can do is to have conversations...but especially the awkward and uncomfortable, even painful, ones. You can learn to not hit back with snarky comments, and to take time to think about what you need to say. But you have to have the conversations to get any growth in the relationship. A lot of arguments are perpetual; they have no resolution. Gottman estimated that [around two-thirds of the arguments a couple has](https://www.gottman.com/blog/a-is-for-arguments/) are like this. A couple can revisit these to has them out again, even if they don't change; or, they can be left along. This means not needling your partner because they like something odd that you find awful, like eating spam. If one person is simply trying to provoke a reaction, that's simply being mean. I suspect that some personalities types are more likely to engage in an ""argument"" rather than a ""discussion."" But the underlying issues are probably similar.

I mean, if it means that much to you, throw caution to the wind and start over I guess - but when you're at the level of self-loathing you seem to be at, it's highly likely that achieving the goal isn't actually going to fix the self-loathing, because it's self-perpetuating at this point.

5.0,"According to your perception. Do you drive better than the others? Why?[SEP]Yes I drive better than 90% of people on the roads. I’m a HGV driver UK. Driving something bigger and heavier than anything else forces you to look ahead/ anticipate and predict further than a car/ van driver. See a green light 50 yards ahead, probably going to change so adjusting the speed is crucial, cannot just slam on at the last minute. Changing lanes on a motorway? In a car mirror signal mirror manoeuvre. Truck mirror signal, mirror, mirror, apply lock, mirror, manoeuvre. Always one idiot who tries to blast past. Roundabouts/ turns. Bigger vehicle equals greater turning circle. We need wider arcs to turn and thus sometimes need to use both lanes or encroach on other traffic lanes. However, in some turns you need the opposite lane that’s marked ie turning left at 90* you need the middle and or the right hand lane just to make the turn.

I felt really dumb in class when I couldn't get an answer right and considered dropping the class, it was my last year at high school, but I thought that it was too important of a subject not to learn. The head of the math department was fairly new and wasn't originally from our school, she had only been in the job like a week or something. She came into our class after the test to see how we'd done and basically accused me of not trying hard enough in front of everyone because they had higher scores than me. They knew I was struggling with this shit and yet my teacher never stood up for me. I was never one to talk back so I just sat there in silence as she ranted about how I was lazy and unwilling to learn, despite only being at the school for such a short time. I was pissed.

Wind can happen where there is low pressure next to high pressure and the high pressure air rushes in to fill the low pressure. This is also the exact place rain happens. Then also wind happens when temperature differences make a lot of hot rising air and cold falling air move around. And dumping a bunch of water on something is a good way to make it change temperature fast.,0,0,0,1.0,0

I'm the type of person who values family over anything else, so I don't mind swallowing ego to forge relationships with the people I love. That being said, if your own family hurts you, that's different. If you alienate your family for no reason, why shouldn't your kids ignore you in the future? Forget about not being able to meet their aunt/uncle; they don't have to give you respect either. I mean, I'm not trying to tell you, but just make sure that's what you really want.

There's a difference between ""that was mean but it was just a joke stop being sensitive"" and ""that was mean and nobody is laughing but you and you dont care.""

I save rubber bands and some of those twist ties, as well as chopsticks, utensils from restaurants and condiments. All of it comes in handy. I use the rubber bands on partially used bags of frozen veg and whatnot. And the twist ties: repaired items- emergency swimsuit fix when my clasp broke, also when my front close bra popped open. Used them for Christmas decoration holders when they were missing. Used to wrangle loose keys all together. Rigged up some Halloween and Christmas decorations that needed repair.

I think it's up to interpretation on how the Joker felt about his ""defeat""/capturing at the hands of Batman. Continuing that thought, I think either he found it funny and respected it or was devestated, because Batman once again showed the world that he is incorruptable and that there are still good people left in Gotham.

But for some reason, I sort of expected my next relationship to be more of the same. Because, even though I was no longer in the army, I traveled a lot and was gone for extended periods.

I told him he could walk away from me at anytime but he could see it was hurting me bc I had feelings for him and he had feelings for her. I’d asked him a few weeks before if I could spend his bday with him since he was off that day but the Friday before we had a talk and decided it was probably time to stop. Even though he swore he only had plans with his mom for his birthday he said he didn’t feel ok about me coming over the night before - even though I’d planned to leave in the afternoon. I knew that ending things would happen eventually but the fact that he decided he’d prefer to spend his birthday alone (allegedly) than hang out with me for a few hours really hurt.

5.0,"How does one go about finding the research articles that are most cited/viewed for a topic?[SEP]Those are massive fields and papers are way more focussed than that so your question doesn't really make much sense. For example a paper on CTCF regulating gene expression could be extremely highly cited, but so can a paper on GWAS looking at schizophrenia. Both genetics, but two totally different pieces of research. Also number of citations doesn't correlate to highest quality research - there are lots of of things that skew citation rates. If the first author is a woman the paper is less likely to be cited. If the journal is famous, more highly cited. If the topic is controversial lots of citations but many will be disagreeing with the paper's findings. Lastly, journals game citations to improve impact factor - there are various ways of manipulating it. You can't rely on citations or impact factor as a proxy for quality.

Horror, post-apocalypse, and other oddities in a convenient Wikipedia-like format (not a book but still reading) I personally didn’t like it bc I don’t like YA stuff as much but a lot of people like Mortal Engines if you want to give that series a try S.T.A.L.K.E.R universe is set out to release a first book in English some time this year.

It’s also immensely terrifying knowing that if they’re “that” old, I must be getting older, too. I’ve seen many kids enter the military, travel abroad, have kids, and become successful in their chosen trades. I’ve had kids come back and tell me how much what I taught them helped them later on. I’ve had kids email me with science questions long after they graduated college. My favorite, though, was when I was leaving a school for another state and a former student came for a visit during my prep. I found out later that he drove himself to my school after he got out of his school despite not being old enough for a license and not telling his parents he was taking the car. He had heard I was leaving after the end of the year and didn’t know how else to tell me goodbye.

I worry that others will piss on Japanese music as a whole because these aren't sung the best. Personally, I LIKE that they aren't sung the best. They don't need to be. I think that makes them so unique and different from what's out there, not to mention the singer is a tenor, if not soprano at times, which is so rare in this kind of music (in fact, the singer may be the only one with this range in this genre).

If you didn't want to spend that, you could pay the slightly cheaper tram down to the exit and pay 5 dollars for the toilet. That path just went to the exit. To get back to the park, you had to ride a stupidly long and very expensive train that went all the way around the park and dropped you at the entrance.

If my boyfriend had someone texting him and calling him pet names (honey, sweetie) it would def be cause for concern. He may have started seeing someone and needs to set some clear boundaries with you. All you can do right now is wait for him to get in the right space to be able to talk with you",0,0,0,0,1.0

My wife and I both agreed that to that before we had kids. We were concerned mainly about what you had mentioned in your comment, that they would always want to come to our bed rather than sleep in their own rooms. We also took into account both my wife and I move around a lot in our sleep and we were worried we could accidently hurt our child, or worse. Of course when they were newborns they slept in a crib next to our bed, and we do occasionally have 'sleepovers' where our kids will sleep on the floor of our room. That has worked well for us, and I have known other parents that have co-slept. Some have had no issues, others regretted it.

If you've done something wrong, own up and explain on your own terms instead of evil people adding lies and rumours on top of what you actually did! Being honest doesn't mean being idiotic, bear in mind. I get by with milder terms like for example a terrible meal being ""definitely not to my taste"". If you say something positive about something that was terrible, I find they'll just do it again. Of course I've made people angry because they were begging for flattery while pretending to ask a real question, but those types of people aren't worth associating with and often witnesses are relieved by you saying what they were all too afraid to say themselves.

5.0,"What is the difference between mathematics and metaphysics in Kant?[SEP]Kant's rejection of metaphysics as science comes from his distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal. The noumenal is the ""truest"" reality, or that which exists independent of the mind. By virtue of existing independent of the mind, it is impossible to know anything about the noumenal world. So, questions of God or of reality that go beyond the purview of our experience can never be proven either way. Kant does, however, argue that metaphysics has a purpose in the phenomenal world (the world that we **do** experience. The phenomenal is dictated by what **synthetic a priori functions.** These are the faculties of intuition, understanding, and reason. According to Kant, these faculties exist in every rational being. Because of this, it is actually possible to make demonstrative claims about the phenomenal world. So, metaphysics is much better as a **critical philosophy.** It's better at teaching us what we don't know, rather than what we do know. Mathematics (because it is found through reason, intuition, understanding) is possible as a science in the phenomenal world. It operates within a constant set of principles; principles necessary to the phenomenal world. Metaphysics as a science is impossible because it's trying to make claims about the noumenal world, which is impossible. Simply put, mathematics is possible because it operates solely in the phenomenal world and is consistent with synthetic a priori concepts. *\*Edit: I should qualify this by saying that I am by no means an expert on Kant, although I have read Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena.*",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Fucking magnets, How do they work?[SEP]Magnets are made of metals that contain many electrons. Each electron has a negatively charged magnetic field that surrounds it, and the field has a direction, perpendicular to the direction the electron is spinning. (See right hand rule). An electron is like the Earth. It, too, has a north and south pole, defined by its magnetic field. In non-metallic metals, the fields of the electrons point in opposite directions for each atom, causing the fields to cancel out and creating a net magnetic field of zero. However, in a magnetized metal, the magnetic fields point in the same direction, creating a net non-zero magnetic field. The magnetic field of a magnet, because it is formed by magnetic fields of the electrons, also have a north and south pole, which is why most magnets also contain two poles. Two similar poles repel each other while opposite poles attract. When a magnet nears a non-magnetized metal, its magnetic field causes the electrons in the non-magnetized metal to align and face their opposite poles towards the magnet, causing a magnetic attraction, which is the force you feel when you hold a magnet next to another metal.

As I began to really like F1 I started spending more and more of my free time with it. (Less whatever and more F1.) I found that there are many ways of learning to play properly. You need to know how real F1 rules are to get the most out of them, you need to learn how the fucking game works because sometimes it can be a mystery. Beyond literal learning there is physical practice when you learn tracks and the car. And there is racing experience like with strategies. So a lot of stuf to worry about but what kept me hooked for so long is how you always feel like improving even after hundreds of hours. You always get more comfortable with the tracks your mindset always improves, you'll learn how to get the most out of the limited info you have.

My only suggestion (from personal experience): also allow yourself sufficient time to chill (guilt-free!) between those endless hours of writing.

4.0,"Eli5, how is it that when you pee, all the colour from what you’ve had to drink is taken away?[SEP]Because of what your body does to the drink, which is kinda complicated: Drinks are made up of a bunch of different chemicals. Some of those are useful to the body, so it keeps them. Some are harmful, so it gets rid of them in urine. Others don't ever go inside the body at all, they just remain in the digestive system. Let's follow a drink from your bottle to your toilet. You have a can of diet pepsi. In this diet pepsi are many different ingredients, but the ones we'll look at are water, carbon dioxide, aspartame, caffeine, sodium benzoate, and E150d. Water is the base of the drink, carbon dioxide is what makes it fizzy, aspartame is what makes it taste sweet, caffeine is what makes it addictive, sodium benzoate makes sure it's not too acidic and E150d gives it that coke colour. You take a drink, and the pepsi goes down your neck, into your stomach, and then into your small intestine. In your small intestine, water is absorbed into the blood stream, hydrating you. Carbon dioxide is absorbed into the blood too. Aspartame however degrades rapidly into three new chemicals: aspartate, phenylalanine and methanol. All three of those things are absorbed into the blood, but aspartame is so easily degraded in the small intestine that no aspartame survives long enough to be absorbed. Caffeine is absorbed too, as is sodium benzoate. E150d however isn't absorbed, because the cells of the small intestine don't have the ability to absorb it. The colour component of the pepsi remains in your digestive tract, and will continue on down that until excreted as faeces. Since that's already brown though, you obviously can't look at it and go ""oh yeah that's the colour of pepsi!"" Meanwhile, the elements of the pepsi that entered your blood are water, carbon dioxide, aspartate, phenylalanine, methanol, caffeine, and sodium benzoate. Of those, carbon dioxide, methanol, caffeine and sodium benzoate are all poisonous, so the body needs to get rid of them. Carbon dioxide is easily removed - the blood hands excess carbon dioxide to the lungs, which gets rid of it by breathing out. The liver gets rid of methanol by turning it into acetic acid, which can actually be used to generate energy in a similar way to sugar. Caffeine is slowly degraded into three less toxic molecules (which I'll just call dead-caffeine to avoid throwing even more fancy words into this), and sodium benzoate is turned into hippuric acid. So, finally, the body has to get rid of the three kinds of dead-caffeine and the hippuric acid. It does that through the kidneys: These bad chemicals are extracted from the bloodstream, diluted with a bit of water to prevent them solidifying as kidney stones, and sent to the bladder for later urination. So the end result is that of the six chemicals we tracked in the diet pepsi, only one of them actually made it all the way through the body into the bladder: the water. The others were tragically lost along the way - one became faeces, another was breathed out, and the rest were transformed into more useful and/or less toxic chemicals. Nothing of the original pepsi remains, so the colour of your urine is determined instead by the colours of these new chemicals, and of other poisons pulled out of your body by the liver.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Like do they really need to be as pricey as they are?[SEP]Purchasing an item which can travel thousands of miles, carry hundreds of pounds of cargo, move in excess of 85mph consistently, and only costs the price of a gas tank to run- this is a very good deal. You can get a car that can do all of these things for $2500, or even less. You can also get thousands of upgrades, meaning your car could do waaaaaaay more things like “have working windows” “have more than 4 seats” “have an air conditioner” etc... and these will all drastically raise the price... because that stuff costs to produce/fix. Expensive cars are not only decked out in features, but are designed for efficiency and storage, and even looks. It’s the next level of car; it’s not just a thing with wheels, it’s a personalized and customizable mode of transportation. And maintenence- well you can actually maintain a few things yourself, if you spend enough time on your own reading and learning what to do. Most people don’t actually do this and will pay for a auto shop to fix. Real issues with the car (not scheduled maintenance) is quite expensive, but generally these are car-specific problems, and you need people confident in their work to be fixing those kinds of things",0,0,0,1.0,0

The fact is, you are still a Ph.D. student and so it is probably true that some of your ideas that you spend a year and a half on will seem half-baked. That's not an insult, it's just that people keep maturing and developing significantly for years *after* the Ph.D., so it seems to me perfectly imaginable that a reviewer with high standards could find some of the work of a very good Ph.D. student in the 4th year to be half-baked. And though I know that there is more publication in graduate school these days, your advisor might be right to encourage you to slow down a bit. It might be that he/she thinks that 3 really good publications are better than 6 in mid-tier journals. Maybe that is true (but it isn't my field so I don't know). I am not generally one to encourage people to get Ph.D.'s, but since you have done 4 years, it might be good to finish (if it is not too painful) and have the degree, start preparing yourself for a switch, and at that time apply to different kinds of jobs and see what happens.

4.0,"How do you let go of the past?[SEP]Get other people involved. Not to help you forget your past, but to fix your problems as much as possible. Use every resource. The more negative a situation is the harder it is to get out of it or to even be motivated to get out of it, for example you spending 12+hours reflecting is a perfect example. So get everybody that can help you with an issue involved, and even if you only get one thing fixed from all that effort, your one thing closer. In terms of letting go of the past, for now just don't. Pick one thing from the past that you still do/recently did (don't start out too serious or you will burn out) and get cracking on fixing that. Once it's fixed, the past will let itself go. I'm telling ya",0,0,0,1.0,0

There are times where I would get caught up telling an English speaker something in Spanish and vice versa. It’s also quite difficult when you’re speaking in a meeting, giving examples in English, which then you have to translate those same examples to Spanish. Trying to fit in all the details in both languages can be quite cumbersome, especially if you’re more familiar with one language than the other. Although, just like with everything else, practice makes perfect and you can pick up some helpful cues in the language once you surround yourself with it.

Xmas when family all gets together I was always told they don't allow dogs in the house so I had to have a sitter to join in. After 9 years of this, one brother let's slip in casual conversation that their parents-in-law turn up with their dogs all the time and the kids all love the dogs. To both houses. On a regular basis.

The debt was issued in good faith and if every bit of debt was cancelled, there would be more faith in currency. Think of it like this. You work to earn money. If someone asks to borrow money from you with the promise of paying you back, you say Here you go, you just pay me back monthly. But I’m not talking about pennies. I talking half of your yearly paycheck. What would happen if they decided to not pay you back at all? You would go on but at a drastic different lifestyle considering you have lost a lot of income. Eventually you will make enough to recover but what if you lost your job in the mean time? Or got in a bad accident? The rest of your bills would start piling up and you might not be able to pay your bills and have to cancel your debt with bankruptcy..... See how that snowballed? That is what would happen if all public debt just went away.... Everyone that expected to be paid wouldn’t and then they would be able to pay their bills and so on and so on.

We've had a few characters compare it to Fox News, in a manner that suggests that its reputation for sensationalism and, on certain issues, biased slant, is well-known. However, in the interests of even, balanced discourse, Jameson does allow sort of a counterpoint segment in the newspaper that provides alternative takes on various superhero-related news (I don't know if it's currently running, but when it was it was called The Pulse and was written by Jessica Jones). JJ is also widely known in the journalism world for his coverage of the civil rights movement back when he was a cub, and that coverage was apparently fair, balanced, even unusually positive for its time, so it's not like every Bugle headline is the exact same thing.

5.0,"Could you guys offer your best tools/advice on how to plan a self-learning semester please?[SEP]I am pretty good at this, but I wasn't always good at it. I think the key that might help you is to break it down into parts, and conveniently most subjects taught in University are already broken down into parts for you, be that chapters in a textbook or homework, activities, and tests. So instead of thinking of it like ""I want to learn Hindi ..."" (the language), you instead break it down into something you can actually learn with measurable success, such as ""I want to learn to draw the characters in the Hindi alphabet"", which you can further break down into ""I want to learn this character ..."", or ""I want to learn to draw the vowels ..."". You just keep breaking it down until you have a plan that you feel will lead you to success, something that you can make progress on, instead of some giant insurmountable goal like ""I want to learn Hindi .."", which is basically impossible to do as a task. Then it is a matter of record keeping, allowing yourself the freedom to fail and get bored and wander off to do something else occasionally, making your goal re-entrant so that once you do get bored and wander off you can come back to it and pick back up on it, etc. Sometimes you will hit roadblocks and have to negotiate around them, the usual stuff. So in terms of your University work, .. that is already broken down into parts for you. So that's how I would approach it. Don't think about ""I want to learn \[insert subject\]"" and try to tackle it as a semester, but instead look at whatever you learn in a single class and try to tackle that. Maybe that was just one kind of math problem that was trying to teach you one very specific math rule or something. So learn that rule. Get on Youtube and look around and try to find various professors teaching that rule. Find some practice problems and work them, really LEARN that rule. Then once you have it, move on to whatever you learned in the second class. I mean that's why they break it down like this, why you have homework problems, etc, why you are taught a certain amount each week and have all this ""free time"" in University (i.e. the time you're supposed to be studying) ... so you have time to really learn what is being taught. I'm really good at learning on my own. I have used this example before because it is a good illustrative thing I can point to about learning things and self-improvement, but last year I learned to drive a tractor trailer ""on my own"". I put that in quotes because I did have people teaching me at various times, but I was the one managing the learning, .. i.e. I didn't go to ""truck driver school"" to learn. Instead I broke the task down into parts and found a way to learn the individual parts. So, for example, there is a ""pre trip inspection"" part that I learned by watching Youtube videos and going out and practicing on trucks that I had access to. Later I learned to back the trucks up. I learned to do brake checks. I learn to do in cab inspection on my own. I learned to drive the trucks (here I needed help, of course), etc. I just broke the task down, and I learned the individual parts. Then I tested and got a Class-A license. There's nothing magical about ""learning by yourself .."", all it is is learning how to teach, and then teaching yourself. You are basically your own University professor, you are figuring out a lesson plan (for yourself), and then holding classes (for yourself), demanding homework (of yourself), and giving yourself tests, etc, ... the trick is that you are learning to manage your own learning. That, itself, as a skill you master through constant practice ... meaning that the ability to learn on your own is, in fact, an ability that you will learn on your own, if that makes any sense. It's a skill that you will get better at through practice. You are essentially learning to learn by yourself, by learning, by yourself.",0,0,0,0,1.0

I'm a little bit different of a person than I was 10 years ago, but I'd like to think it was for the better because I have a lot more personal experience to go off of. ""Wisdom comes with age"". I'm cognesant of the fact that we tend to latch onto mindsets that make us feel comfortable, but I also can recognize that things change over time. That being said, there are some feelings that I had 10 years ago that still ring true, especially with the new experiences that I've had. Some things just stay solid.

That is why fathers seem so important - and they are! To us. Humans. The secret to mammals’ success has been this strong family unit. The parent or parents teaching their young, sheltering them, raising them. Future generations benefit from the things past generations have learnt. Anything else seems wrong and horrifying - because we are literally wired up in our brains to clump together and protect and teach the young and helpless. It’s who we are. But to an octopus, fathers are rather less important. They don’t have the same development trajectory that humans (or other mammals) do.

I’ll even spend development days just reading other works so I can look at how other people write and the techniques they use, so I can add those tools to my writer’s toolbox. I think having days where I don’t write but instead think about writing is very helpful to me, because it takes the pressure off me to not constantly write.

Another head cannon explanation that is actually supported by the books (although Chamber of Secrets contradicts it) is that students are sorted in to houses based on their most prominent character trait, e.g Gryffindors are courageous. If they were to remove Slytherin, it could potentially exclude hundreds of students who don't fit the requirements of the other three houses.

Unavailable? Well he died, rather suddenly. And the whole family was invited to his funeral. I surely went, for his children and my remaining family. We had service and it was pretty well-filled. But then grave service came and there were so many people. The line of people wrapped nearly the whole graveyard. From his job, his different community services, his sport activities. I was stunned how many people wanted to say goodbye. It was amazing and sweet to see someone was so loved, but nonetheless bitter that I had so little connection to him. That he was gone was pure bitterness on its own.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELi5 - How do clothes get dry when hung outdoors in winter?[SEP]Temperature is not what stops water from boiling, it is air pressure compared to vaporization pressure. The vaporization pressure depends on temperature. Water evaporates at lower temperatures than the boiling temperature, it can in fact evaporate at all temperatures it is a liquid. The name change so sublimation went is is solid but is still occur. The rate is temperature-dependent and if there is a net loss of water depending on the moisture level because water condensates too back to a liquid, so a net loss of water depends on the relative humidity of the air. A simple demonstration that is not temperature is to put room temperature water in a vacuum chamber and is start boiling with the pressure get low enough. The boiling requires energy and that results in the temperature of the remaining water dropping. The boiling will continue until the remaining water has frozen to ice. The Ice will sublimate, go from a solid directly to a gas but the rate is quite low. The energy requires for water to become a gas is almost identical at 100C as at 25C. It can be determined by measure the temperature drop of the water. It is this energy that water on our skin takes from our body that is the reason you can cool yourself down by sweating. The rate liquid water becomes a gas does depend on the temperature, at the same time water as a gas will condensate back to a liquid. Let's take a container that starts with a vacuum and fill half of it with water. It should be disconnected from the vacuum pump but it should have a pressure gauge. The result initial boiling but then you get an equilibrium where the evaporation rate is equal to the condensation rate. You now have liquid water on the bottom and water as a gas on top. You can measure the pressure of the gas and if you heat the water the pressure increase. When you 100C, 212 F the pressure will be 1 atmosphere, this is not a coincidence. At room temperature, the pressure is at 3% of an atmosphere. If you do not have an enclosed container the same process will occur water evaporates until the amount of water in the air is the same as in the container. If the air is not replaced with dryer air you have an equilibrium and the amount of liquid water remains constant. But air can move and if it is replaced with dry air the water will continue to evaporate until the liquid water is gone. So water will evaporate at all temperatures where it is liquid. When it becomes ice it will still become a gas but that is sublimation. The rate of evaporation, sublimation, and the amount of water that can be in the air is temperature-dependent. Let's look at boiling without a container. If you look at water that boils you see bubbles forming in the walls of the container and they rise to the surface and disappear. These are bubbles of water as a gas that are formed on nucleation sites, that is irregularities on the container or anything else where water can form bubbles. If water would start to form a bubble and the vapor pressure is less than the atmospheric pressure the result is that the will be compressed back down to a liquid. If the pressure of the gas is the same or higher than the atmosphere then the bubbles will support themselves and can grow, detach and rise to the surface where they can escape into the air. The gas that leaves the water will because of the pressure be able to push away the air. The result is that water can evaporate at a high rate in bubbles in the liquid as long as the temperature is high enough. This is what we call boiling. So it is not temperature directly that is required, it is vapor pressure versus atmospheric pressure. You can boil water in an enclosed container too. A pressure cooker is a pot with a lid and a valve that open as a set pressure. The result is that the boiling temperature of water increases. The pressure is generated by the gas the water release. The same way the boiling water at high altitudes occurs at a lower temperature because of the lower atmospheric pressure. So water will evaporate as long as it is liquid. If you lose liquid water will depend on the moisture level of the air. At 100% relative humidity you will not lose liquid water as long as the water is not boiling Boiling is not directly a question of energy or temperature but one of vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure. The vapor pressure does depend on the temperature. So there is a connection between temperature and boiling but it is not a question if enough molecules have enough energy. If that was the limiting factor water would not boil in a vacuum chamber at room temperature",0,0,0,0,1.0

Then there are pictures of him reading a newspaper upside down with his back sticking to a wall and him wearing sneakers standing horizontally on a wall. Spider-man 2099 on the other hand has talons that protrude from his fingertips and toes which are sharp enough to cut steel, but instinctively retract when he touches his own skin or other people. So he won't cut someone's hand when he shakes hands but he can call them forth when he needs them like when he cut Venom 2099's hand off and he asked if he was carrying some kind of concealed weapon (I just thought I'd add that because not all Spider-men are created equally).",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"High/Epic Fantasy with romantic subplot?[SEP]You seem to have almost exactly the same taste as I do, so let me see if I have a few suggestions. Naomi Novik's Uprooted and Spinning Silver, while each a stand alone book, gave me very similar vibes to the Winternight trilogy. Both have romance, but it's next to a fascinating fantasy based plot, deep relationships between female characters, and excellent character development. What I really like about her books is that the heroines have goals and character development outside of the romance, and the romance doesnt solve all of their problems, while still being really compelling. Kristin Cashore's books are YA/NA with a slightly more romance focus, but similarly, her female characters all have goals and plot points that don't solely revolve around the love interest. The world building is really interesting. Graceling, Fire, Bitterblue, etc. Susan Dennard's Witchland series is super popular. While I didnt like the direction the plot took in later books, I know I'm in the minority, and it really fits the bill of what you described. Female POV (though there are multiple POV's including men), epic fantasy, multiple books to sink your teeth into. The romance is there, but it's a minor plot point for sure, at least in the first two books. S.A. Chakraborty's Daevabad Trilogy is fantastic. Honestly, if you pick any one of my suggestions, this is the one. It has everything, politics, magic, romance, excellent character development. I would say that the first 15% of the first book tricks you into thinking it's going to be a run of the mill fantasy romance in terms of plot, but really she's just setting up this complicated world with some plot beats that are more familiar to the reader. (At least that's my opinion of what's going on). The romance is there, but the plot is really more focused on character development and exploring issues of privilege and tribalism while luxuriating in this lush middle eastern setting. Lois McMaster Bujold's Sharing Knife series is slightly more romance focused than Witchlands or the Daevabad trilogy. But at 4 books, it's meaty, and there is a good fantasy adventure plot that takes equal space with the romance. I honestly recommend anything Lois McMaster Bujold writes.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"If Megalodon and Titanboa suddenly returned, by whatever means, to an ecosystem completely unused to the presence of such large predators, what would be the impact to the environment and to human activities/survival?[SEP]That would be an anachronistic invasive species (or something) question. So, like giant shark I think fed on whales but unlike whales, it didn't have the range or like biological aspects to move outside warm and shallow waters (relative terms). So, I think whales and dolphins if presented with this thing would do some avoidance stuff but at the same time though, while these things were huge they're still within like predator stuff in the ocean now (but maybe 3x larger or something) - I think that they would have a nominal impact overall to different creatures and ecosystems and even less so to humans. The giant snake thing? There are invasive species (e.g., pythons) in the everglades and they have a profound and significant impact on ecosystems and stuff. So, adding this other thing into the mix would further complicate things and would be very bad. As far as impact to humans?

4.0,"Is searching for meaning a narcissistic act?[SEP]I'm not totally sure what version of narcissism you're using. Narcissism is usually psychological or clinical. The psychoanalytic theories can be different still from the more colloquial diagnostic reference to grandiosity, selfishness, exploitativeness, etc. You're right that the pursuit of meaning has sometimes been anthropocentric though and perhaps even narcissistic in the Western tradition. Descartes rooted the locus of knowledge in the thinking self, and so a lot of philosophy went down a path-dependent trajectory toward thinking in terms of selves. But I would argue the pursuit of meaning is anti-narcissistic. Narcissism tends to involve an orientation of devaluing others in favor of an overvalued self. When we struggle with the question of meaning -- is there meaning in existence, where, why -- we have to think rationally beyond our own drives, wants, needs, impulses, etc. If we reject the possibility of some kind of real meaning in the world, we have little left but the satisfaction of our own drives and desires. So to the extent that meaning forces a (collective) consideration of something real or even consistently valuable beyond the self and its subjective wants, it seems that meaning is actually the way out of narcissism. Your other point was that it supports our delusions of being important or having significance. Well, the problem with foreclosing on meaning and saying humans lack significance -- or the world lacks significance -- seems also to lead us toward a position where we can devalue things. There are problems with overvaluing our position in the cosmos but there seem to be equally significant problems with treating it as value-less. So again, without a further argument, I see issues in both directions and struggle to conclude how pursuing a theory of meaning is any less prone to justifying narcissism than is pursuing a theory of nihilism.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"Can the method of dialectical materialism explain dialectical materialism's own emergence?[SEP]&gt;As a philosophy, dialectical materialism's content and conclusions are, according to its own principles, either totally determined or at the very least delimited by the current relations of production. I want to be clear and not misleading. It isn't about prediction and it isn't as if history was an agent apart from human beings. It's about the connection between the thought of an age and it's material base. In that sense, yes, Marxism is explicitly a theory about*capitalism*, concerned with the contradictions within capitalism. By its own understanding, it will fade away, become obsolete in a communist future. Marxism is built upon a critique of capitalist concepts that wouldn't have come to be apart from the rise of a capitalist mode of production, i.e. there would never have been a Marxism in ancient Athens, only in modern Athens. Hegel is not Marx, but he also noted that his thought depended on (was a negation of) Kant, who depended on Hume, etc, each of whom reflected movement in the idea of freedom. Hegel as the negation of the negation, the world process becoming aware of itself, needed those other periods first, as I understand Hegel. Hegel saw his own philosophy as only being possible due to his location in history. This is even more true of Marx.

Every time we write, we learn how to write a little bit more. We notice our mistakes, discover plot holes, realize something we thought was cool last week is actually boring and falls flat. That isn't a bug, love, it's a feature. Personally, for myself, I don't commit to writing my first draft until I love every part of it so much that I couldn't dream of changing another thing. Even then, during that process, there are things I realize I loved for the wrong reasons, or things that just don't allow for the best flow, and I change them anyway. If you're getting bored with something you've created, the best case scenario is that you've just gotten too close to it and as a writer, you find it less exciting. The more likely scenario is that your skills have improved and you're able to realize it is actually boring and readers wouldn't enjoy it either.

5.0,"ELI5: How was the very first computer able to understand commands? How did they code a system to understand code in the first place?[SEP]The very first computers didn't understand computer code, they were programmed by hand using a series of switches. The famous Bronze Goddesses used to decode enigma during WW2 were programmed manually in this way. But you could argue they weren't true computers yet, as they were mono-task devices. Programming computers by hand was inefficient and impractical so the concept of the computer language was invented to be able to quickly program computers to perform repeatable tasks. Assembly languages were developed in the late 1940's which were the first computer languages. The computer processors were designed in parallel with the language in the same way that you design a car with a steering wheel and pedals otherwise you wouldn't have a way of driving it. The limits of assembler however is that you need an extremely high degree of understanding of computers and their operation to use it. It isn't practical for anything but the most basic of functions. To make computers do more we invented high-level programming languages that would act as an interface between humans and complex computer logic. Essentially creating a tool that allowed humans to write the logic (a computer program) and then translate it into assembler using a tool called a compiller. The first such language was IBMs FORTRAN created in the late 50's. Higher level languages like C came much much later. The compilers of those languages transform the easier to read code into assembler (machine code) underneath that the processor can understand. Modern languages like HTML, PhP, JAVA etc go a step further in that they produce code meant to be translated by an intermediary program, which in many cases is the browser. The browser in this case is the interface that transforms web code into machine language.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"Is it ever worth it to read older editions of philosophical works?[SEP]It really depends! Different translations have different strengths and weaknesses. It also depends on the purpose of your reading. Some translations (like the Irwin of EN) are more accessible english than others that may be more faithful to the original Greek (like the Ross as a classic translation). How old a translation is may just mean some of the commentary or a word here and there will be a dated term (Burnyeat, for instance, is a pretty timeless translator but has a few things here and there that are funky.) On the whole, though, the year something was translated and published doesn’t really correspond to much else quality-wise. A lot of times you can look up translation reviews and places like Bryn Mawr Classics Review and others will have thorough write-ups comparing the different translations. In general, though, I think it’s fair to say that a big publisher will tend to put out a solid translation. Newer does not necessarily mean better.

4.0,"ELI5: Do things have limited scent/odor molecules? If you leave a spoiled piece of fish out does it stop smelling bad eventually?[SEP]You are asking two different questions entirely. To answer your first, no; if something has a scent, as long as there is any piece of that thing, it will have that scent. If it's reduced to a few molecules, it might be too faint for humans to smell with our noses, but the scent is there, however faint, until the molecules are removed or converted into different molecules. Spoiled fish smells bad due to bacteria decomposition, not the fish, so that's why your second question isn't very accurate. When the bacteria completely decompose the fish so that there are no more fish molecules, then the scent of the fish will be gone. Long before then, the odor of the bacterial byproducts will overwhelm our sense of smell and make us throw out the fish. Eventually the bacterial byproducts would stop smelling when they became broken down into other materials, but that would take a while. Please don't perform this experiment.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"Did Democritus and/or Leucpipus respond to Zeno's paradoxes of/arguments against motion? And if so, how?[SEP]I searched the book *The Atomists: Leucippus and Democritus* for mentions of Zeno and didn't find anything about responses to his paradoxes of notion, although the book mentions on p. 164 that there was an atomist argument against the infinite divisibility of matter which was similar to the [argument from complete divisibility](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ArgComDiv) which was said by Simplicius to originate with Zeno. But the book also argues on p. 165 that there was a conceptual difference between the argument attributed to Zeno and the atomists' argument: &gt;There is, however, a crucial difference between Zeno's focus of interest and that of the atomists. Zeno is trying to show that every magnitude must be infinitely large; his argument is that every magnitude is divisible into lesser magnitudes ad infinitum, and that an infinite number of magnitudes of finite size sums to an infinite magnitude. This argument is concerned purely with theoretical division. Physical division ad infinitum of every extended thing is not possible in practice, and even if it could be demon- strated that below a certain threshold physical division is theoretically, and not merely practically, impossible, the argument would not be weakened in the slightest. The atomists, on the other hand, are concerned to show that things cannot be physically divided ad infinitum. That emerges clearly from their question 'What will be left when the division has been carried through?' If this question is asked about mathematical division it is only too easily answered; suppose that the infinite mathematical division of an extension has been completed, what will be left will be exactly what was there at the start, viz. the original extension. But if we think instead of physical separation, the force of the dilemma is clear. Imagine the original extension to have been separated into infinitely many subparts; then we are left either with an array of extended things, each requiring further subdivision, or with a set of unextended things. According to https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/ there were some ancients who proposed the idea of ""time atoms"", i.e. the idea that change proceeded in discrete increments and was not infinitely divisible. It's possible this idea was partly meant as a response to Zeno's paradoxes of motion which assume the infinite divisibility of time, but the idea is not attributed to Leucippus or Democritus, the article in [this section](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/#PlatPlat) that Plato may have believed in time atoms: &gt;It has been suggested that Plato accepted time atoms, i.e., indivisible minima in time, but this is controversial. A report by Aristotle suggests that the belief of Plato’s student Xenocrates in the existence of indivisible lines was also shared by Plato; other testimony suggests that points are really what Plato refers to as indivisible. And in [this section](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/#DiodCron) it says: &gt;For those who posit indivisibles as a way to escape paradoxes about infinite divisibility, parallel arguments might equally well have been applied to the problem of completing tasks in an infinitely divisible time. Sextus Empiricus reports that the Aristotelian Strato of Lampsacus (d. 268/70 BCE) argued for time atoms, although this is contradicted by other sources. Sorabji 1983 suggests that Strato merely countenanced the possibility that time could be discrete while space and motion are continuous, without endorsing this position.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"What does it mean for something to be ""real""?[SEP]Depends what your context is. If you think that ""real"" is synonymous with ""objective"" then you can have two ways of thinking about reality. You can think of objective like the 3rd person intersubjective agreement, or objective like in the classic sense, which is devoid of subjectivity (Pierce). They are not mutually exclusive, but we typically speak in the former sense for everyday things. So a mystical experience like hallucinations could be deemed as real if there is an agreement that such experiences occur. But for the classical sense of objective reality, the answer seems not be as clear since, as you said, it is a distinct subjective experience. One would have to determine if such an experience counts as an objective part of reality, maybe doing some Nagel-esque formulating of the ""complete picture of the word"". But as for the content of hallucinations, they are purely subjective and thus not objective in either sense.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Creatives perhaps are more frustrated by it because they actually TRY to do it. Don't limit your medium to drawing or writing. Combine as many as you can or need to. Try to identify where you are having difficulty. Like with drawing. Personally I can't draw very well, but I remember seeing a course once called Drawing is Learnable Skill. This might not be your specific problem, but my point is learning the basics, the tools, the language, of various creative mediums will help a lot in your ability to utilize them. Try new mediums. Learn as much about them. And keep trying. Also, don't be so hard on yourself. There is just no way that drawing can end up in complete failure. It's not Chernobyl. You can start over, or keep going.

In general, special scholarships for college etc. Are good and clever, because you open a field to underprivileged people.

Too many people copies something they like without grasping why it worked so well in that specific context, and so their copy feels flat and contrived - because it is. You have to find a way to deconstruct and identify the essence of the show that you like, condensing it into a simple format, so you can conceptualize what makes the show great. By detaches what makes the show so great from the show itself, you can apply the concept without referring back to the show it came from. That way you can make something that draws inspiration from a show, without it ultimately hinging on that show. You can't just copy a scene from a show and expect the impact to be the same, but if you deconstruct and identify what makes that scene so good and apply those principles to your own thing, then you can recapture the essence of what made that scene so good in a way that complements your own story.

5.0,"What is happening when you’re loading a new browser window on your phone and it refreshes a bunch of times?[SEP]This is probably due to buffering. Buffering in few words is your computer receiving and processing data from servers so you can visualize the web pages in your screen. Obviously the server will be sending and receiving the data from your computer so it will need to refresh over and over again until you computer have processed all the information needed to let you visualize the webpage. (it will need to refresh because pages are static, they cannot change in real time but they can get updates, when the page updates it will need to refresh to show you the actual thing.) That's also the reason why slower connections means slower loading times, your computer needs to download all the data before showing you the page. Just like you would download anything. Like, you cannot play a song without having it saved somewhere. You need to download it first and then you can listen to it. Is exactly the same thing with pages. The only difference is that when you make a change (send data) in the page or the page needs to show additional information (receive data), it will need to download more data and refresh the page.",0,0,0,0,1.0

There was a woman behind the wheel, and she was really, really drunk; her face had gone through the windshield, and there were pieces of glass sticking out of it. She was screaming, and flailing around. The teacher was a small woman - she said one of us needed to run down to security to get help (pre cell phones), and she didn't think she could keep the woman down, so asked me to stay with her. So I stayed there for probably 20 to 30 minutes, trying to keep this super drunk woman calm. She had knocked her front teeth out, and there was lots of blood from her mouth, and from the glass in her face. She was also wearing a whole bunch of some kind of perfume. I don't know what kind of was, but every now and then I'll pass a woman in a mall who is wearing that perfume, and it instantly brings back that day.

5.0,"How old are you and what age gap do you think is significant (platonic wise not necessarily dating)?[SEP]I'm in my 30s and i don't see there being a specific age gap that is universally significant. It depends on what the purpose/reasons are for the interactions. For example, I have many friends as part of a board game group that I joined 2 years ago. Attendees range anywhere from 18-40, sometimes someone brings along their 10yo kid, sometimes there's another family member brought along that's into their 50s and 60s. In these groups, we play a variety of games and split off into smaller gatherings depending on who wants to play what, so age isn't a factor. You can be immature and an ass at any age, and that's the only thing that causes issues. Making friends and meeting folks through gatherings like video games, DnD, and some other hobbies also kind of removes the element of age. How you behave and carry yourself matter most. As for actual dating purposes.. I'm going to go a bit against the grain and say that no age difference matters, \*as long as\* everyone is very open to communicate what the relationship is and isn't, and boundaries are set so that the power/maturity dynamic isn't brought into play. I have no worries about someone seeing someone half their age and keeping things relatively casual. I might not agree with or want it myself, but i don't fear for the younger party. Moving in together, making large purchases, becoming financially/emotionally dependent.. those are the kind of things which become huge flags and worry points for me.",0,0,0,0,1.0

I dream a lot and I remember my dreams - this was no dream. I was back in the 70s in Santa Barbara - I was renting a room in an old house when I was in college. They were never at home as they were building another home elsewhere and stayed there, so I was alone in the house. I had an exam the next morning and had set my alarm for like 5 a.m. to go over things beforehand. I'm a deep sleep so my alarm was set to a radio station on a very high volume. At 5 a.m. that alarm went off and my eyes sprang open. My bed was such that on my left side, I was starring at my door and the radio alarm was on the other side. My eyes spring open and I see this 'man' heading towards me and the bed, almost floating. I can see his long curly hair, his bell bottom jeans and wide buckle belt and long sleeved jersey shirt, but he has no face. And as he's getting closer, I'm flicking my toes and fingers and trying to assure myself that I'm actually awake, and as he get to the edge of my bed, he vanishes. I would guess it was several minutes before I could move and turn off that loud alarm. I've never experienced anything like that ever again. That was not a dream.",0,0,0,1.0,0

She got out in the parking garage, not her usual spot, and on her way into the building heard someone yelling for help. She though they had fallen to the ground between some cars and needed help so she went to look what happened. Turns out this lady had been walking I to work and the drainage grate in the parking garage collapsed under her. She fell about 12 feet into a concrete drainage shaft and was trapped there. Mum called emergency to get her out and was told that if there had been water in the shaft the lady could have been swept into a water storage tank under the garage where no one would have ever heard her.

Otfried PreuBler's books - I loved Krabat I read Scandinavian children's lit authors like Lindgren, Lagerloef, and Jannsen in German - the translations are top-notch. Some of Janosch's books are pure genius. Der Froschkoenig is the bomb.

I know exactly the scenario. But tell exactly what you just wrote to your teacher before or after class, he or she should at least be sympathetic. However, I don't think you should try to ""get out of it"" entirely. You need to at least try singing with your teacher when no one else is around. A decent teacher should try to help you overcome your [~~goal~~] vocal anxiety, but it can be tough. But a lot of the teacher's work requires group singing, so he or she may try to encourage you to sing with others. As a music teacher, we get it, especially middle school students when their voices are changing. Boys voices crack completely uncontrollably, and some students have a full range of about four notes. I know, I was an adolescent boy once myself. And moody teenagers can get so bitter, jaded, and hateful about having to sing. That's obviously not what we're trying to cultivate in our students, but it can be hard to avoid. Some kids kinda just ""go for it"" knowing it'll get laughs, this liberates them but they typically get stuck in that joke and it's hard to get them to progress. I think of my own singing voice as pretty ugly-sounding, but I was able to overcome my vocal anxiety anyway. If I have any advice, I might suggest trying to look at it from the teacher's perspective. Music teachers have a really challenging task when people are at all different levels, and they have to deal with a tremendous burden of bad attitudes sometimes. At the very least, don't try to make the teacher's job *harder* than it already is.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: what is the difference between oil-based, water-based and graphite lubricants in how they function?[SEP]Water does NOT make a good lubricant. About the only thing I can find that uses water based lubricants is sexual lubricants. The lubrication is not provided by the water itself but by creating gel that works similar to grease but in a much thicker layer. Oil is your standard lubricant and works in different ways depending on the specific application varying from where it's only filling the microscopic layers on a metal's surface to providing a full boundary layer such that the two metal surfaces don't meet at all and thus no welding or wear occurs between the microscopic peaks on the surfaces. Without lubrication two metal surfaces will weld to one another under heat and pressure. Oil circulates in a system where as grease (oil + thickener) stays put. Dry lubrication (like molybdenum disulfide or graphite) functions like a grease where it stays put but it has hundreds or thousand of sacrificial layers. So each time the surfaces met a layer of the dry lubricant is taken off instead of wear occurring to the metal surfaces. It's more expensive than purely oil based greases but can be applied on a much thinner surface, used with much higher temperatures and potentially lasts longer depending on the application.",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"Guys in a relationship, How do you get confidence talking to a girl and how do you get a girl to like you for you?[SEP]you can not ""make"" a girl like you; you can improve yourself to be more attractive and increase your pool of girls. Simple things like hygiene &amp; grooming go a long way even if you aren't super physically fit or a natural greek statue. Also - the movie/book see a random girl on the street so you must go talk to her and instantly go for coffee is mostly fantasy; romantic relationships are something that usually grow over time. this doesnt mean months or years but usually at least a couple weeks of casual interaction. romantic relationships are just like regular relationships - you have to have things in common you have to have established contact. The first thing you should do is work on your verbal and non verbal communication. Tell yourself TALKING TO THIS GIRL WILL NOT LEAD TO A DATE/ROMANCE.

When you are working in 45 minute increments your brain will feel less overwhelmed. When you come back, take a piece of paper and list what you did the last session - what stuck with you.

5.0,"your opinion on characters looking like their personalities?[SEP]I might get downvoted, but a lot of traditional culture uses this: in the anglophone sphere, notably Dickens and maybe infamously J.K. Rowling, but also in medieval and ancient tales around the world. The physical is used as a representation of the moral and thus the wicked is as misshapen as the righteous is fair (as shown by the double meaning of the word). I often end up on the wrong side of this, but I must admit: I don't care much. &amp;#x200B; Of course we are writing in our own time and in our own globalised culture, but we should maybe not take too literally what is meant to be symbolic. If you are going to write a somewhat realistic story, of course it doesn't make sense for your characters' flaws to show in their appearance, but one might argue that a fairy tale wouldn't have to follow the same rules. Then again, maybe in your story, fair hair is a sign of duplicity (I don't even mean in a complex, fantasy-like imaginary culture, but as simply as Roald Dahl wrote that witches have square toes and wear pointed shoes. Of course, the toe-less community might take offense, but then...) Plus, of course, you can always play upon the trope, as has been done in classic works such as *Beauty and the Beast.*",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"How to Calculate My Working Hours When I'm Constantly Distracted by ADHD?[SEP]I have never been diagnosed with ADHD (nor approached anyone to be tested for it), but I have always struggled intensely with procrastination and being easily distracted. So I don't want to say what is normal for ADHD, just speak from my experience. &gt; there is definitely a risk of being exploited when I'm only being paid for 30 hours of work The way I have always treated this in my jobs is, they are paying me for 30 hours of output, not 30 hours of being on the clock. When I have a week where I spend a lot of time goofing off when I'm supposed to be working and therefore end up spending 60 hours at the computer instead of 30, I don't consider that exploitation. Obviously everyone has off-weeks, but this happens very regularly for me and it is an idiosyncracy of my brain, and I don't think that my employer should pay for that. Maybe this is wrong, but that's how I see it. &gt; my boss said that I ought to be able to crank out something like 15 pages a day Whether that's a reasonable expectation or not is a different question, and I appreciate that it's a difficult one to answer when you're also living with being easily distracted. It may be that your boss's expectation is not reasonable *and* you're not producing enough by some objective standard. And it's hard to solve both issues at once. It does sound like the situation is becoming hostile though, so from a completely different perspective- I'd start looking for a new placement. &gt; how much distraction time is normal for a healthy person to be included in their work hours When I was researching this, a number I found frequently was 45 minutes on/15 minutes off if you're not hourly. Obviously, it doesn't have to be literally that; for me it's sometimes easier to concentrate for a few hours and then goof off for a full hour.",0,0,0,1.0,0

It is the most malleable part of your story and can be easily changed later with little to no consequence.

4.0,ELI5: How should I recognize what time signatures are used in songs?[SEP]Firstly time signatures can be ambiguous. A lot of songs can be written in different time signatures and still be played the same. So guessing a time signature that is different from what the sheet music say does not necessarily mean you are wrong. When identifying the bars you should be listening for the first downbeat of the bar which is often emphasized. So you would count 4/4 as **1**\-2-3-4-**1**\-2-3-4-**1**. And this is usually audible in the music. It does not always sound as obvious as in for example waltz but after some practice you should hear this in most songs. And when you listen for this and also for any rhythmic repetitions you should be able to identify a bar and then just count how many beats there is in that bar. So if you hear something like **1**\-and-2-and-3-and-4-and-5-and-6-**1**\-and-2- ... you are dealing with a song in 11/8.,0,0,0,1.0,0

A week after the incident, I was on a subway train in Seoul, snoozing a little bit. And then, I felt someone patting my shoulders. It got turned into light hitting very quickly. I opened my eyes and looked at the direction where it came from. Right next to me, a young lady was desperately tapping my shoulders and pointing her index finger in front of her. I naturally looked at the direction and I found.....Clearly a homeless guy, with super dirty clothes and skin that reeks of not getting bathed for such a long time and the guy was spinning a bottle cap of paint thinner which is the same catalyst used in Daegu accident, opening it and closing it back and forth..... Wow, the atmosphere of the scene.....literally everybody got frozen. The lady desperately looked at me as if I had to do something about the guy. What was I supposed to do? Hit that guy? Nah, I stood up and got near the door and prepared to run as soon as the train stops. The best part is, the guy just got off the train at the next station.

The first walking stick, it was cheap wood, the top was carved in to a lions head, probably bought at a rummage sale or something and definitely bought with the pocket money of a 5 year old and an 8 year old. With in a month of us buying our dog decided it was a chew toy. The top of it is ripped to shreds and unrecognizable anymore. When my dad died I fought to get the walking sticks. Over the years they got progressively more expensive, progressively more artistic and interesting. We kept buying them, at least 2 a year, until I was 16, so there is 25 of them. Some are glass, some have hidden compartments, some are intricately carved. Theres even one made out of marble. They are displayed in a stand by my back door, and I look at them with fondness tinged with melancholy all the time.

There’s no difference it’s what most would consider a consistent “ordinary” inner voice. Those who have been Deaf from birth and are fluent in sign language don’t actually “hear” an inner voice. It’s rather they picture the sign for the word in their mind. From studies it seems incredibly unique and complex and we likely won’t be able to comprehend it as normal hearing individuals.

As you move around and as you breathe all the particles you breathe inn will get caught in the slime and slowly make their way up.

The sheer shock of seeing 10 lbs of human waste on the floor startled him so bad that he took a step back. His back hit the stall door and he felt a squish... One of the perps had grapped a turd and drew a giant smiley face with a have a nice day in the stall door and my friend got a full imprint of it on his back...

5.0,"People who don't talk to their parents anymore, why?[SEP]The reason I don't talk to my dad any more is perspective. Growing up it's hard to see how rough or messed up things are. It's all just normal, you know? And even then, things rarely go from happy to falling apart overnight. It's a longer process, something that gets gradually worse, no given day especially more broken than the one before. But then I was an adult, and I had kids of my own. And I'd talk with my wife about my childhood. And she'd say, ""that's pretty messed up."" The floor went to rot until you simply had to know which bits of carpet or linoleum had support underneath and which didn't. We'd run out of propane and it was simply left that way, unheated, for months on end. Of course, the big 'wtf' flag that kid-me hadn't really put together as messed up was the porno drawer. My dad had a filing cabinet, and the bottom drawer was usually locked. However, every so often it wasn't and I - being a nosy little snot - would rummage through. It was full of burned CDs of adult material, much of it featuring animals or children. Anyway, that's a good chunk of why I'm not on speaking terms with my dad.

The source code is all laid out in a logical, human-designed and human-readable format, and then a compiler turns that into a much tighter, optimized, machine-readable version of the algorithm which is described by the source code. This machine readable version is called, appropriately, machine code. There do exist programs called decompilers, which can go the other direction and give you source code from a piece of machine code. But a decompiler isn't just like ""Give me *the* source code this was compiled from."" It's more like ""Give me *a* source code which, if compiled, would produce this machine code.""

Since there is no real answer that I'm aware of, perhaps my speculation is a valid response. I think it might have to do with the fact that a child at that age is experiencing SO much, it's ALL new. So between the early ages, say 2 years old, and asked at 3 if they remember something from 2, they might say yes, but at 5, maybe not? It makes me wonder if they just aren't really used to reflecting on things, because they are constantly taking in new stuff. I've wondered if you ask a child periodically to remember an event, if that memory will be preserved into adulthood. We'll see, going to test that theory myself.

4.0,"ELI5: How do they digitally remove an actor from a film that's already shot?[SEP]So the term you’re probably looking for is image inpainting. Basically, it’s easy to cut an actor out of a frame and paste a new actor in, but there are a couple pixels missing. We have a couple different ways of filling in the gaps. 1. We can use a statistical model to guess at the color of each missing pixel from the surrounding pixels in this frame and the pixels from the surrounding frames. This’ll end up kind of blurry, but we mostly don’t notice it. 2. We can use 3D models of the background and other actors. A 3D artist creates a model of whatever they think was behind the original actor and uses that to render the missing pixels. This approach is a lot of work for short scenes but might pay off over lots of frames. 3. We can tweak pixels by hand. This approach is difficult and time consuming for your effects artists, but it’ll get things right eventually. The part that’s crazy to think about is just how much work goes into each second of a professional film. There’s no magic technology answer, people just do a lot of work and spend a lot of money to make each moment perfect.

Sometimes the official retail experience does suck, too. Like having to deal with a midnight release crowd to get a new sneaker. Why shouldn't people be able to pay $100 to have someone do that nonsense for them? Also those sneaker releases are artificially limited and annoying on purpose, to build hype and get all those stories about people desperately waiting in line for the not new product. The company is making the experience crappy for their biggest fans in order to sell more stuff. Now I agree that scalping is annoying... but I see it more as the inevitable result of limited supply. I don't really blame the individual scalpers, they're just cogs in the wheel. Manufacturers and retailers *could* bypass most of this crap, but it's in their interest not to.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I was hitching a ride to my friends house and a newer model car stopped. As a teenage girl that thought she was street smart, I would always ask a couple of questions to size up the driver before getting in the car. He was a clean cut middle aged man, nice demeanor, so it was a go. I opened the door, hopped in, and happened to look down before pulling the door shut...there was no inside door handle. I looked over at the driver and every hair on my body was standing on end. I knew in that moment if that door shut I would never be found. I noped the fuck out of there and ran away as fast as my skinny ass legs would take me. That was the last time I ever tried to hitch a ride.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"Is there a philosopher who attempted to justify eating meat/dairy?[SEP]Traditionally, Kant is understood as justifying eating meat. See e.g. [here](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/htmlreader/978-1-78374-388-9/ch14.xhtml#:~:text=Kant%20says%20of%20a%20person,in%20his%20dealings%20with%20men%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=Perhaps%20it%20is%20the%20case,or%20an%20endorsement%20of%2C%20cruelty.) - for Kant, what gives us rights is personhood, and animals are not persons. Personhood means we are rational creatures able to figure out our duties, which animals can't - hence they aren't capable of having rights, either. (Don't misunderstand old Immanuel here to say we can mistread animals. As the link above outlines, quite the opposite - but Kant apparently thought there's no issue with eating meat as long as the animals aren't treated cruelly) However! Not all Kantians agree on that. Christine [Korsgaard](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3198692/korsgaard_FellowCreatures.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y) famously develops an argument that Kantian ethics should really forbid eating meat.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"What was your ""Wow! That worked?"" moment?[SEP]Whilst working on my lab project I had a lab day that was pretty much a cascade of problems and difficulties from start to finish. Skipping over most of it, I was at the point where I needed to evaporate my samples, I specifically requested a tank of nitrogen for this and one was set up for me in the morning. I didn’t get to it until the evening, and some fuckwit decided they were gonna use the whole tank and then leave it. At this time of the evening the technical staff who have access to more tanks and stuff like it had long since gone home so I couldn’t get a new one, and I couldn’t leave my sample either, cus if they didn’t get evaporated and reconstituted, then they’d expire. I could not let this happen, those samples were taken at a specific date I’d outlined in my methodology, and I only had the ones I’d grabbed on that day. So I needed a solution really quick with whatever the lab had to hand. This was for me to set the samples in some test tubes, precariously balance them in a beaker, and put that beaker in a heat bath. After about half an hour of me staring intently at the bath, to see if the samples had f i n a l l y evaporated, and to make sure they didn’t fall over and lose my samples forever, they actually did evaporate. To this day it still stuns me that actually worked",0,0,0,0,1.0

Sooooo for you I could recommend trying to keep a purse/backpack with emergency supplies (basic first aid, a knife, flashlight, tampons/pads, a hand towel or two, even snacks, a water bottle, etc etc etc), emergency mechanical supplies in your trunk (car jack, oil, jumper cables, etc), set reminders on your phone for bills or important events, and remember to always breathe! The idea is so you can go enjoy yourself knowing that even if something happens you'll be able to take care of the problem easily. Tire flat? No problem! Cut yourself? Easy. Caught out in the dark? Make it less dark. Can't forget bills if your phone is in reach. I would also recommend keeping a smart watch on you.

5.0,"Eli5 how was language first made? How are languages translated?[SEP]The first languages weren't really 'created' as such. Linguists debate over how exactly they came to be, but it's thought that they evolved over time in order for humans to survive and develop. Humans are naturally social creatures and so would use sounds to communicate. Each sound meant something, whether it was pointing at something, making commands, or using sounds to indicate a feeling. It was all about communicating with other humans, but it was also a means for survival. We don't know exactly when the first languages were created because they don't exactly leave fossils, but its thought anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 years ago languages began. Over time, these sounds became more sophisticated and humans successfully merged grammar systems (also observed in songbirds) and lexical systems (also observed in some primate species that have specific calls for different predators) into what we have today. As for translation, our most important goal is to keep the meaning and 'feel' of the source language in the target language. This requires you to not just be proficient in your 2nd language, but very good at your first language as you're effectively 'co-authoring' for a new audience. For most languages, grammar and sentence structure are very different and you can't just swap out words and call it a day. You also have to take into consideration social/cultural factors. It's not really enough to be able to speak two languages fluently. For example, I translate between Japanese and English. In Japanese, swear words aren't really a thing in the same way they are in English. So when translating a 'vulgar, rude' character to English, using a direct translation may seem too polite for the new audience, and when translating a similar character into Japanese, I might find I have no words to work with and have to rework the sentence! A translator's main goal is always keeping the intended feel of the text (vs. interpretation, which is more about getting the most important info).",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"ELI5 What is a logarithmic scale? Why is it more useful for some things than a regular numerical scale?[SEP]Imagine you wanted to plot the net worth of people in your area in a graph that shows all the data. Now most of the net worth will be around the lower end with some higher in between. So you can nicely see how the worth is distributed among the people. Then suddenly Elon Musk decides to join your area. Now your nice graph is screwed. Why is it screwed? Because the number line that previously was at let's say 500k max suddenly jumped to 147 billion. So the graph, as it is supposed to show all points, now is squished such that Elon Musk is at the top, a single outlier in the whole distribution. Even the richest guy in your area before is a measly 0.00034% on the scale. (Yes that's right, those are 3 zeros after the decimal AND it's percent. That is how laughable 500k are in that distribution) This makes it impossible to see any difference between the 500k guy and the 300k guy the 30k guy and so on. They're all down in the same line from Elons perspective. So now you take a logarithmic scale, meaning you take their net worth, throw it into a logarithmic function and then plot that value. You obviously have to adjust the y axis accordingly. The 30k guy is now a 4.47. The 200k guy is now a 5.3. The 500k guy is now a 5.7. And Elon? Well he's an 11.17. These now fit on a single graph and you can still make out differences between the ""smaller"" numbers. Logarithmic scales are generally often used when exponential growth is concerned, like population growth, spreading of diseases. Also when you have to work with data that spans a huge range of values, like comparing the size of objects in the universe. Using logarithmic scales and transformations is very common in machine learning and data science.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Neurotypical Children of Autistic/Special Needs Parents, what was your childhood like? What is your current relationship with them? And finally, if you had the choice, would you want different parents?[SEP]My mother is autistic, she's in her 70s and was diagnosed as an adult as it wasn't really a thing when she was a child. Her behaviour caused my father to leave when I was very young, leaving her raising 3 kids alone. She doesn't really understand jokes or sarcasm, so you have to be careful how you phrase things as she'll take most things literally. Any change to routine is a struggle, which meant I always had very strict rules about where I could go, how long I could stay out for etc. For example, if I was visiting a friend, I couldn't call her and ask to sleep over, as that wasn't The Plan. My friends always thought she was great; she always fed people, made a big fuss on birthdays etc, but it was because she had taught herself certain social cues and expectations. When it was just family she was completely different and usually closed off. She also doesn't like any music. At all. She says it's just irritating noise, so I got used to wearing headphones a lot. The hardest part was that if anyone upset her (regardless of intention), she would just... stop talking to everyone for days at a time. When I was little she would keep making meals, doing chores, bedtimes etc, all just in silence. I'm in my 30s now, and we've got a really good relationship. I don't visit her often but we talk 3-4 times a week. When I was growing up I remember crying myself to sleep and wishing for a different mummy, but now I understand her better, I think she did the best she could raising us. One of my nephews is autistic, and I think its helped her having someone she can relate to a bit more.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It was especially common to bet marbles on games, ostensibly making the playground a soft casino. It was actually pretty savage and resulted in a lot of confrontations which is ultimately why it was all shut down and marbles had to be banned. I was part of the reason for that. So I was playing against someone that I thought I could beat. I couldn't. And after a few games I was in debt pretty badly. I was hustled. And he immediately started to threaten me to cough up so I had to buy time. So I scrambled, I gathered marbles, I hustled a bunch of kids in turn. I even borrowed marbles from my friend and didn't tell him that I was using them to pay back someone else. And these were marbles he liked, a couple were quite distinct. So I pay the guy back and it is after school. My friend comes and notices this other guy using his marbles and asks for them back. The one with them argues they are now his. My friend says no they are mine. They get increasingly in each other's faces. Meanwhile I slowly ghost into the background. My friend kicked the god damn shit out of the hustler and got his marbles back. I don't know if he ever truly connected the dots, I don't really think he cared. And the scary part? That wasn't even close to the worst thing that happened due to marbles in our school. But I did always feel bad for taking advantage of the fact my friend was apparently a thug.",0,0,0,0,1.0

You will *not* be underprepared for college as long as you show up ready to learn. Think of it this way, if you needed to know more about economics than the layperson before you even set foot in a college classroom, what would the point of college even be? No matter what college you end up in, you'll most likely still have to take an introductory economics course, and you'll learn what you need to learn there. It's great that you want to learn and are interested in diving into the topic, but don't stress about learning the material - focus on *exploring* it. What are the different areas and specialties of economics that really excite you and why? What sort of careers seem intriguing? Are there economists or professors that really inspire you? Besides reading books, you can also subscribe to financial news magazines and papers, listen to podcasts about economics, and follow economists on social media. (NB: most current scholarship the social sciences is going to be happening in peer-reviewed journal articles, not books, but reading journal articles is actually a pretty poor way of learning the basis about any given field - they're going to be too specialized).

5.0,"Should I submit my paper to an undergraduate journal or a graduate journal?[SEP]The most mileage you are ever going to get out of a paper written as an undergrad/ first-year MA is publication in an undergraduate journal. That could help you with PhD admissions in a couple of ways: (1) it's a nice thing to have had a paper published in an undergraduate journal, even though it certainly will not guarantee you admission to a great PhD program, and (2) if you include the link to the essay on your CV, it will give the admissions committee another piece of your writing to look at besides the sample of your academic work that you will submit with your application. Sneaky, yes, and no guarantee that the admissions committee will read it, but perfectly okay to do. Publishing in a graduate student journal while in a PhD program, on the other hand, will accomplish very little. While in a PhD program, students usually aim to publish in regular, discipline-specific scholarly journals. I can assure you, as the director of an MA program and with absolutely no insult intended, that while this particular essay might be terrific for an undergrad/first-year MA student, it will definitely not be up to par with the PhD-student work one sees in grad student journals, and it will not even be in the ballpark of what one sees in regular journals. This is not casting aspersions on your work. This is the case merely because you have not yet completed your graduate study, and you are going to learn SO MUCH in the next few years that by the time you are in the third or fourth year of your PhD program, you are going to cringe when you read this essay.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Over the course of our 2 weeks together I grew close to her, still not speaking much, but getting comfortable with her physical affection and comforting her during her breakdowns. I liked her, but like with every girl I meet, I immediately think of all the reasons why she would never date me or why I couldn't burden her with dating me. What really drove that mentality with her was overhearing a phone call she had with someone that sounded a lot like a conversation one would have with a boyfriend and just like that I concluded that it would be impossible. After the 2 weeks she was about to get released (I came in a week after her so I still had a week to go) 10 minutes before she was about to leave and join her parents we sat at a table and said our goodbyes when she hit me with ""So are we dating now ?""

4.0,"ELI5 : How are videogame codes protected ?[SEP]Some of the explanations on here are going into a separate issue (recovering source code). This really has nothing to do with what OP is asking. OP you are right that in theory a program can be transferred to other computers simply by transferring all the files. In fact this is exactly what people used to do back in the day and it worked. I remember when software companies started to require a serial number (usually found on the physical packaging). You would need a valid serial number or the software wouldn’t run. At first, software would check that a serial number was valid based on an algorithm it ran itself. Later when the internet became prevalent, software would require an online validation of a serial number. Now that most software does not come in a physical box, the protections are all happening behind the scenes I would assume. I’m sure any major software company has piracy protection built into their software. So to answer your question, yes it is possible in concept but highly illegal and most software has hidden protections to prevent you from successfully doing this.",0,0,0,1.0,0

We packed the hot pancakes into the freshbox so they'd stay hot, packed a small mini table, some silverware, my best plates and a pretty kitchen towel and went over right in time for her break.

I number my foot note stickies and place them in the books and then just write them up in order. The footnotes also help me to organize my thoughts. It's something about having squares on the page that helps me focus. Also - set a timer on your phone for 30 minutes. Just spend that 30 minutes thinking about these ideas and how you can use them.

4.0,"ELI5: if gold bullion is a good investment, why do companies sell it?[SEP]The best way to make money in any market over the long term is to broker transactions and take a piece of every trade. Price goes up and some people buy in while others take their profits off the table - great, charge them both for every sale. Price goes down and some people scoop in to pick up a bargain while others cut their losses - great, charge them both for every sale. Either way, you don't get stuck with the asset itself, and you're largely immune to short and medium term trends. Some precious metal dealers maintain a small inventory which they use to be on one or the other side of a trade, but for the most part, even that is designed to be a way to bring buyers and sellers together rather than an actual investment the dealer uses to make money. It's more nuanced of course, but better to make a buck on each of 10,000 hundred dollar trades every week (whether prices are rising or falling) than than buy a million dollars worth of assets today and hope you can sell them for $1,010,000 next week.",0,0,0,1.0,0

If I make an affirmative claim like ""I have a $20,"" I can produce the $20 and prove that it's true. Proving the nonexistence of gods is like walking up to someone and making the claim that they don't have $20 when you don't know. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. Maybe they have a combination of bills that make $20, or maybe less or more than $20. The $20 could be anywhere on their person. You might search their wallet and their pockets, but the $20 could be stuffed in their sock. Even if you didn't find it your claim is still false. How does one interpret ""having"" $20. Maybe they don't a $20 bill but they have at least $20 in their bank account and access to that account in most situations. To prove the nonexistence of something you would have to prove that the claim is either impossible or that so much evidence is lacking that it can't be true. For me, personally, the absence of evidence is enough proof that gods don't exist. But the idea of faith is the ultimate ""I had one hiding my sock"" argument.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Looking at the solutions offered by Amanda Askell in this blog post, at least half of the challenges she responds to aren't particularly strong arguments to begin with. For example, point 3: &gt;Pascal’s wager assumes key features of the god it seeks to prove the existence of. For example, that god rewards belief and not non-belief. Isn't really an argument against Pascal's Wager that you'd commonly hear since the very point of Pascal's Wager is that one doesn't need to assume anything about the God you decide to 'back'. The point is that whether or not God would be responsive to such a Wager, it still makes sense to pledge to a God because it makes your chances of eternal paradise *something* rather than *nothing*. There are lots of examples of straw men arguments in this post but for me, the closest thing to a robust argument is point 11: &gt;But we don’t have voluntary control over our beliefs! Tellingly, she doesn't really engage with this question, she simply asks if the reader really believe this. But it's an important point; can I make myself actually genuinely *believe* something just because it's beneficial for me? Intuitively no. Might be motivate me to find reasons to hold such a belief? Yes, perhaps, but the crucial point is that the source of the belief is not just the wager itself.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It could be possible that disagreements bring up issues of self-worth and not belonging (which are normal fears). Perhaps you have past experiences in which you've been criticized, made to feel less than (e.g. intellectually), were rejected etc for having different thoughts. Perhaps differences were modelled to be a negative thing in significant past experiences. Whatever the case, it's a protective mechanism for you.

Act 3 the resolution. Let's take The Wizard of Oz as an example. Act 1. The viewer learns of the main characters. They learn about Dorothy getting thrown into a new fantastic world. They learn about her journey to meet the Wizard and the yellow brick road. The world is set up for the viewer to experience. Act 2. Trouble comes to our main characters and a confrontation occurs. Dorothy is captured by the Wicked Witch of the East and her friends must sneak into a castle and save her. Eventually they defeat the Wicked Witch of the East and are able to continue on their journey to see the Wizard. Act 3. Dorothy and her friends finish their journey and meet the Wizard. Story lines come a close. Each of the main characters gets their reward (A brain, a heart, and courage) and Dorothy is taken back to her home and the story concludes.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: How do ""flash loans"" in blockchains with smart contract support work?[SEP]&gt; This concept just doesn't pass the sniff test.. That's cryptocurrency for you. &gt; This seems like it allows one to attempt to profit without any downside. My understanding is that the borrower has to pay a fee no matter what happens. This is all generally used for arbitrage, i.e. exploiting price discrepancies between equivalent assets or between different markets. People do that with normal finance too, e.g. they'll buy a commodity on one market and simultaneously sell the same thing on another market for a higher price, or they'll buy and sell some combination of financial derivatives that effectively ""cancel out"" and leave them with a profit no matter what happens. This does sound too good to be true, but in practice it can take a lot of work to find and exploit arbitrage opportunities, and there is always *some* risk, e.g. a market might suddenly crash in the brief period of time between executing the transactions, or you might run into a legal problem that renders one of the derivatives void. With a ""flash loan"", the loan, the arbitrage transactions and the repayment are all rolled up into one transaction. And similarly with standard arbitrage, there are possible downsides - apparently people have found ways to exploit loopholes in the system and cheat the other party out of money. By the way, a very common assumption made in economic models is that arbitrage literally never happens, which tells you a lot about how much trust you should place in economists' pronouncements about the economy. &gt; What about the third party in this case? If someone takes out a flash loan and buys crypto from me, then the crypto goes down in price (meaning that they can't make a profit), how is the transaction rolled back? I sold them crypto and now that sale is undone? Since everything happens in a single transaction, for the third parties I don't think it would be any different than if the transaction had failed to go through for some other reason.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Upon a first viewing there's a point where things go from fairly straight forward to suddenly very confusing, and you're quickly playing the tape backwards in your mind to try and fill in gaps to explain events while the film continues to move forward and add more.

You'll probably want someone well-read in Althusser, who I am not, to identify more thoroughly his reading of Marx and how that emerges in Zizek's presentation of Marx. Zizek's line on ideology as a kind of symbolic field that immediately structures our subjectivity is due to Althusser, and so if you do indeed watch *The Pervert's Guide to Ideology* this is the kind of ideology he's talking about. I can brush up on my Althusser (and my Althusser as it pertains to Zizek) quickly and come back, but I hope for now this gives you a direction in which to start looking.

I would go as far as to say that everyone SHOULD question their relationship before marriage. It's a big step and not because you now have to decide on what kind of wedding you want, if you even want one. A few things that I questioned was: -Is this person mentally/emotionally stable, if not, am I willing to put up with/work through these issues with this person?and are they willing to do the same. -Are we improving each other's lives or detracting from it? What do I want to get out of this marriage with this person that I love. What do they want? -What does this person's debt/credit score look like? If it's shitty and they have a lot of debt, am I willing to take half of their debt and pay it for them? Because your debt is now theirs and theirs is yours. -and which head am I thinking with? The one with the brain or the one that makes me horny. One makes sense and the other makes us dumb. Marriage isn't just love, there's a lot of logic, planning/coordination, patience and understanding, mandatory discussions and disagreements. Marriage isn't just love, it's work, its hard work.

4.0,"ELI5: can someone please breakdown the differences/relationships between Linux, Unix, Bash, and Terminal (MacOS)?[SEP]Unix is an operating system that was first developed around 1970 by Bell Labs. The development branched to different projects including research unix. Research unix was further developed by UC Berkeley and released as Berkeley Software Distribution or better known as BSD. BSD had some licensing issues with copyrights that some people disagreed with so a group created a fully free version called FreeBSD. A company called NeXTSTEP took aspects of BSD and FreeBSD and put them together with a unix base to create their own operating system. Apple bought NeXTSTEP and took their operating system and rebranded it to become OSX which is now macOS. A software engineer named Linus Torvalds wanted to play with unix while at university but couldn't afford the licensing costs so he tried to create his own version and released it for free called Linus's unix: linux. It's not even close to the same as unix in architecture, but the people who jumped onto the project worked to make everything work well with unix programs. Today, many programs that work on linux can work well on unix and BSD with a few modifications. When these systems were first created, the only way you could use them was via a terminal prompt since there wasn't anything for graphics. Underneath the UI of the modern operating systems are system calls and you can interact with the system via the terminal when needed. The terminal in macOS is a terminal emulator that is a graphical copy of how the terminal works; almost everything you can do normally through the terminal you can do through an emulated terminal. Terminals use shells to interpret commands. The original shell for unix was bourne shell often just referred to as ""sh"". This was very limited over time and people wrote a more advanced shell based on bourne called ""bourne again shell"" or ""bash"". Bash is also a programming language you can use for writing scripts. It's a way to natively interact with the computer via the terminal and how the shell interprets the commands. What you are doing when working in your terminal is working with you computer without fancy graphics and windows. Everything you can do in windows that interacts with the system directly can be done through the terminal.",0,0,0,1.0,0
3.0,"ELI5: how does human sight at great distances work?[SEP]Distance in itself has no effect on if you can see something. If enough light from the object reached your eye you can see it. The brightness of a light source will drop with distance because the same amount of light bread out over a larger area. The result is if there is nothing in between you and a light source there will be some distance where it is to dim to see. So you could not see Jupiter at 1 light year because it will be too dim. You could use our sun because it emits an enormous amount more light than Jupiter reflects. A quice calculation results in 467 million times more emitted light from the sun the Jupiter reflects. This is ignoring that from a long distance away Jupiter will be close to the sun in your field of view so even if you could see it if it was alone you could see it beside the brighter sun. How far you can see on earth have to do with the curvature of the earth and how the atmosphere bends light. The scattering of light can also have an effect. So it is not exactly comparable to how you see stuff far away in the sky. consider if you are in a circular house and put your head out of the window. You would not see a lot of it because it curves away but if you went outside a bit away from the house you could see a lot more of it. You can see a lot further on earth than 3 miles. That is the distance to the horizon if your eyes are 6 feet above the surface for a level area like calm water. The horizon is where stuff starts to be hidden if you looked at your friend that also is as tall as you on a boat 3 miles away the toe starts to be hidden if the feet touch the water. The eyes of your friend will be hidden at twice the distance so 6 miles away. Something tall like a building 60 feet tall starts to be completely hidden a bit over 10 miles away. The distance to the horizon depends on your elevation and if you are on the roof of a building with the eyes at 60 feet the horizon is 10 miles away. Use https://www.metabunk.org/curve/ to calculate the distance to the horizon had what is hidden behind it So you can see a lot more of earth from ISS because it is high up but it is still only 3% of the surface that is visible. The higher up has another advantage and that is air scatter light. Mountain look like they are in a haze because the air in between will scatter light. The amount of air between you and space is equivalent to 8.50 km, 5.2 miles at sea level. So if you look at a mountain 16km away the light passes to twice the amount of air as if you look at it from ISS. There is also more dust close to the ground so looking at ground level will be even worse. So how far you can see in space and one Earth depends on different things. On earth is tuff that is in the way that block or scatter light. In space, the object gets dimmer because of the distance.",0,0,1.0,0,0
4.0,"Is what is considered beautiful socially constructed for the most part ? In that case is physical attraction itself a social construct rather than some objective attraction ?[SEP]I think there is a misunderstanding about what social construction means. Being socially constructed doesn’t mean it is artificially constructed or not real. In Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann’s 1966 seminal book [The Social Construction of Reality](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality.html?id=BEEh1Stk5NIC&amp;redir_esc=y), social constructions posit two assumptions regarding knowledge. First, that it is social, meaning that it is intimately tied to the current social norm, culture, mores, ideologies, etc. Second, that it is constructed, meaning that it doesn’t need to be that way. One can always imagine it looking differently (or constructed in a different way). Case in point, our perception of beauty or fashion changes over time. Of course, what one consider beautiful depends a lot on the way evolution has worked. But, there are things that we value that doesn’t quite make sense from a evolutionary perspectives, such as choices of clothing, hairstyles, tattoos, jewelry, which are all human inventions and institutions and, therefore, socially constructed, precisely because they don’t exist objectively in nature, but inter-subjectively (meaning agreed upon by everyone) in society.",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"ELI5: How does Flash memory work? How is data stored?[SEP]Let’s start with a simple copper wire, a conductor: P _____ N If we apply a voltage from Positive end to the Negative end, then current flows. Next, let’s draw a semiconductor - a transistor: C ___ P_____N There is now a Control Gate on top. If we apply a voltage on the Control Gate, then the P to N path on the bottom is a conductor; but if we take away the voltage on the Control Gate, the P to N is an insulator. Last, let turn it into a Flash memory cell, by adding a floating gate in between the Control Gate and the P to N semiconductor path: C ___ __ &lt;— Floating Gate P_____N If we have charges trapped in the Floating Gate, then from the point of view of the P to N semiconductor, there is always a voltage at its control gate, thus it is always conducting; conversely, if there is no charge trapped in the Floating Gate, then whether P to N conducts depends on the control gate again. So there, you have the basic mechanism to read from a Flash memory cell: If it conducts despite no voltage on the Control Gate, then it has charge stored in the Cell. Multi-level Cells (MLC, TLC, etc) can further determine the amount of charge in the Gate by adjusting the voltage level of the Control Gate.",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"What is time (in the Kantian sense)?[SEP]If you understand that time is a pure intuition and so on, I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you wondering what time is in itself, independently of its being a pure intuition? Because Kant denies that it's anything other than this. If you're wondering what in particular is distinctive of time as the particular kind of pure intuition it is, then the relevant passages in Kant will be *Critique of Pure Reason* A30/B46 - A36/B53. Kant claims 1) that time is an *a priori* subjective condition on our being able to represent things as simultaneous or in an order of succession, the formal structure of which ordering is given in arithmetic; and 2) that time is immediately the form of inner sense (that is, of the sensible appearance of the soul), rather than of outer objects as such, since time does not itself make possible the representation of shape, but that time is also mediately the form of all sensibility whatsoever, since whatever we represent to ourselves sensibly occurs as an inner representation in the mind, and as such is mediated by the form of inner sense. Here are some particular passages you might find helpful: &gt; Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not presupposed as underlying them *a priori*. Only on the presupposition of time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times (successively). (A30/B46) -- &gt; Time is nothing but the form of inner sense, that is, of the intuition of ourselves and of our inner state. It cannot be a determination of outer appearances; it has to do neither with shape nor position, but with the relation of representations in our inner state. (A33/B49) -- &gt; Time is the formal *a priori* condition of all appearances whatsoever. [...S]ince all representations, whether they have for their objects outer things or not, belong, in themselves, as determinations of the mind, to our inner state; and since this inner state stands under the formal condition of inner intuition, and so belongs to time, time is an *a priori* condition of all appearances whatsoever. It is the immediate condition of inner appearances (of our souls), and thereby the mediate condition of outer appearances. (A34/B50)",0,0,0,1.0,0
4.0,"What is your opinion on a woman and a man cuddling platonically, is it possible or not and why?[SEP]I mean, asexual people exist. That's on the extreme side of things, but of course platonic contact between members of the opposite sex is completley possible. This question really gets at one of the emotional problems that arises becuase of how maleness/masculinity is treated by our culture. For (heterosexual) men, physical contact is basically violent or sexual. That's why one of the only ways that men have physical contact with male friends is roughhousing. That's why when a female friend initiates or engages in platonic physical contact with them, they have a tendency to assume it's an indication of sexual interest. It's pretty miserable, tbh. I don't know what it will take to normalize platonic physical affection for men, bit it kind've needs to happen.

She taught us French, Spanish, Pre-Algebra, African History, and standard subjects for second/third graders. She also taught us manners and fair play. We studied about Hawaii and had a luau for lunch and dresses in Hawaiian clothing. She spoke about the contributions and inventions of African-Americans. She taught us about the planets. She had an amazing sense of humor and made us laugh often. She dressed so simple and elegant. She wore skirts with matching sweater sets, with jewelry. She smelled like a flower garden every day. She drove a Thunderbird. This was 1958-59. She invited several of us to lunch at her home one weekend. It was beautiful. She had a porcelain figure of a dog on a chair that I was staring at. Without saying one word, she wrapped it up and gave it to me for my birthday. As an adult, I invited her to dinner with four other students from our class. We had all managed to sidestep the inner city pitfalls. We all thanked her for changing our lives and the lives of so many others in our class. She was 80 and still vibrant, funny, and beautiful.

As simply as I can put it, a memory occurs when your brain reactivates neurons in your head the same way they were activated when that event actually happened. What you sensed, what you felt emotionally, all recreated to remember what happened! (Again, as SIMPLY as I can put it) Activating neural pathways reinforces them, making them less susceptible to being lost, since your brain is constantly rewiring itself and creating new neural connections, (again, in a SIMPLE sense) Trying to recall a memory can take some time for your brain to connect all the dots, and light up the pathways that have since been weakened.

The terms Chaos, Hell, and even (I think) ""The Void"" are used to depict or describe the same dark pit of space of The Netherworld of The Force.

Both these theories are about how we should understand Moral vocabulary. So what they want to know is what we are actually doing when using Moral vocabulary. A wholly different question, and that is what you seem to be after, is the question in Moral psychology about what people think they are doing when using Moral vocabulary. On this first linguistic reading about what people actually do when using Moral vocabulary, the two theories you cited are clearly opposed. We can not actually claim something truth evaluable and at the same time not truth evuable. From the Psychological perspective it is of course possible that some people think they are just expressing Feelings and others think they are expressing facts. However, none of this determines how the Moral vocabulary we all use is correctly interpreted. I hope this helps, have a nice day :)",0,0,0,1.0,0
5.0,"ELI5: Why does missing someone hurt in the body?[SEP]Emotion and physical pain are very, very closely linked. When you feel physical pain, your brain receives information from a pain receptor and immediately cross-references it with other senses, your immediate memories of what you were just doing, your long-term memories of similar situations and sensations, *and your emotions* before it decides whether or not what you are feeling is pain. Emotional pain has a similar process. Your brain processes it in exactly the same way, using the same pathways. It will cross-reference all the input it can, including your physical sensations, memories, thoughts, and feelings, before deciding if you are in pain or not. And then your brain sends out a pain signal. Because emotional pain does not come from a physical pain receptor, your brain chooses a body part that hurts on behalf of your emotions. The usual contenders are heart, gut, or head. These are important, generalised areas that can hurt when something Is Wrong. So basically it’s your brain letting your *body* feel pain as a way of processing your *emotions*.",0,0,0,0,1.0

The internet used to be about finding and sharing different websites. You’d have to blindly link from one site to another. Now everyone is on the same five or six websites/apps sharing content. The difference is that back in the day if you found or heard about a cool new website you could discover hours of new stuff that all felt cohesive and wasn’t anywhere else on the internet.

4.0,"[Dc comics]How does Superman’s ability to fly work?[SEP]According to Ben Tippett's ""A Unified Theory of Superman's Powers"", all his abilities come down to one thing, an ability to alter his inertia and the inertia of things he touches. From the section on flight: &gt;According to our conjecture,fight could be achieved if Superman were to lower by His own mass, and increase the mass of the air with which He is in contact. Flight could then be achieved and sustained by pushing the ambient ""heavy"" air about him. This mechanism, however, does not confine him to Earth's atmosphere; since even outer space is not a perfect vacuum. It's nonzero density should provide enough dust and gas for Him to accelerate by pushing Himself off of it (in addition,He might be accelerate by selectively radiating high intensity photons). &gt;Our conjecture does not only suggest a mechanism for His fight, but it also clarifes some issues concerning how He has been observed interacting with objects, in fight. &gt;Imagine the familiar scenario where a heavy stewardess falls from an airplane, and then Kal El intercepts and catches her, mid fight. This Scene is illustrated in figure 2. If Superman obeyed the laws of physics we would expect that, once Superman caught the stewardess, their collective trajectory would suffer as a result of her monstrous initial momentum. Additionally we would generally expect her to be crushed under the large acceleration, and torn in to pieces by the considerable impulse. &gt;However, from experience, Kal El rarely dips after catching someone midair. This seems only possible if, somehow, Superman were able to reduce the momentum of the caught person. Furthermore, the caught person reports feeling much pressure or acceleration from Superman's arms. If the stewardess' moment of inertia were dramatically reduced prior to the impact of Kal El's arm, her body would suffer less from the impulse, as it would be lightly felt. https://qwantz.com/fanart/superman.pdf",0,0,0,1.0,0

You are thinking about this the wrong way. Your body is a very efficient machine that burns just as many calories as it needs. This is a fairly consistent amount of calories that you can estimate by [using a calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and you can then confirm by weighing your food and weighing yourself for a couple of weeks. The rate that your body burns calories can be increased slightly by your activity level, but there are limits to how much you can increase it. So if you eat only as many calories as your body needs, burning them is not a slower process than accumulating them - it is the exact same speed. If you eat fewer calories than your body needs, burning them is a faster process than accumulating them and you lose weight. If you view food as nothing more than fuel for your body that takes time, money, and effort to consume, the question then becomes why do people expend more resources than necessary to consume calories they don’t need and their bodies can’t burn?",0,0,0,0,1.0

Always give yourself plenty of space, that goes for driving behind somebody, stopping behind somebody at lights/signs and maneuvering. The more space you have the easier it is to see what's going on and you give yourself that little bit of extra time if you need it. Look well ahead when you're driving and try to think ahead, if you're looking well ahead and you see a sign warning you about a side road, that could mean that there have been lots of accidents because a car has been waiting to turn and somebody went into the back of them. You could also seek out further professional instruction (in the UK we have PassPlus and Advanced Driver which are not mandatory but I found them very helpful).

Being a good software developer is hard, and takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. There are whole project management philosophies to become experienced in, there's the art of setting objectives, scopes and requirements, there's version control systems to master, collaboration techniques to learn, the ability to review people's code quickly and effectively. I wouldn't trust someone with a 2 month bootcamp qualification to immediately write clean, reliable, efficient code - that takes years. For an example, take one of my most intelligent friends who's also a programmer. (Top of the class at a top university kind of guy). The company he now works for literally told him when they hired him (and he had a lot of experience programming during his PhD) ""We don't expect you to be functionally useful or deliver anything significant for at least 6 months"". Sure, he could write decent code from day 1, but there was no way he would be unleashed onto the core code and be trusted to develop that software further without a lot more experience. There is so much more to being a programmer than coding. Also, if a company wants someone to just write a chunk of code which is functionally easy to define (e.g this block of code takes data from this source, runs this algorithm on it, and spits out the results like this) - then there are a lot of outstanding programmers in India who you can outsource that work to for a lot less than employing someone in the US.",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"Is it normal for work done by research assistants to be largely ignored by the lab group?[SEP]Do you have regular meetings with your advisor or someone else that could give you feedback? If not, could you talk with the PhD student whose data you're working on, or the post-doc, to get specific feedback on things? This would be my suggestion if lab meetings are viewed as somewhat more formal or if you bring it up and the advisor doesn't think your work would be suited to presenting in lab meeting. I have personally found that having one-on-one meetings with the people who are directly involved or do research highly related to my topic give the best feedback, and help me grow more as a researcher. Whereas in lab meetings there can be less incentive to dive deeply into things that are/are not working and suggest changes or ways to improve the work. When people are in the weeds of figuring out analysis, group feedback hasn't been the most useful. Keep in mind that the purpose of lab meetings can vary a lot from lab to lab as well. In my lab group, lab meeting is very informal and we almost never have enough people wanting to present to fill up all of the lab meeting time. Usually when people present their work, it's either very end stage (comments on a manuscript draft before sending to a journal, polishing a talk that's going to be given a week later) -- or on the complete opposite end and for fun, ex.

I sometimes get all organized and list out what's happening and what I need to do --in advance-- and sometimes it's chaotic and I'm back filling tasks like ""just did"" instead of to-do. I really enjoy making spreads, I find it relaxing. It also eases my (realistic) fear that I'll forget all about something I'm supposed to do if it isn't written down. I think it would help to figure out what works for you. That's the beauty of the system, there's no one right way. Edited to add-- I switch up the look of my spreads and layouts fairly often. Folks sometimes talk about how it should be useful, or it doesn't need to be pretty or not comparing to IG or whatever -- which I understand. However, the way my attention works is that if it's not cute and interesting I will forget all about it and then half my trackers don't get filled out. So I make super pretty cover page and monthly calendar, a tracker page and braindump /notes page -/but the real work happens in the weekly spread. I can't draw so I use stencils and stickers. I do work to make my weekly as useful as possible -- for me that pretty much means keeping it simple. (But still cute) my most common set up is 3 vertical boxes on each page, with the last one split for the weekend. (Week starts on Monday). It's deceptively simple bc I use distress inks, stencils, markers. It tends to look like a lot is going on but structurally is like : write daily tasks and appointments in column, general notes and reminders below. I either leave space blank beneath or do a smaller box below the column. Visually complex but structurally simple works great for me. My memory is super shredded so I do a quick monthly recap page and put favorite memories. I go back to those a lot! Helps me keep good memories!!

Every major Hegel scholar today rejects that this idea exists in Hegel. Scholars in the 1800s did not think so either, and Proudhon's conception was widely considered to be a misreading. Virtually every book of secondary literature I've ever read on Hegel makes great pains to explain and 'debunk' the popular misconception that 'thesis-antithesis-synthesis' is part of Hegel's thought. The postgrad university courses I took on Hegel also took great pains to point this out ('Here's what many people think Hegel meant vs what he actually meant', etc). In other words, it is a popular myth and it is well-known as one. In regard to Marx: no, Marx did not use these terms and did not read Hegel that way.",0,0,0,1.0,0

This helps keep humans advancing with robots and or A.I. Seems scary but look how much influence what was once just a phone to make 2 way calls has become and you can sorta see humans being groomed for a technological Singularity 😉.

Anyway, I can't speak for every schizophrenic person, but I don't find myself offended by this type of portrayal.

It's common in a machine shop to use measurements in thousandths of an inch, so specifying .308 specifically wasn't really out of reach for machinists and their tools.

Giga for 1,000,000,000 and tera for 1,000,000,000,000,000 was added in 1960 Computer memory is addressed binary so it is multiples of 2, not 10. 1024 is a multiple of 2 and people started to be called 1024 a kilo because it was very close in size The same way you get a * mega of 1024*1024=1,048,576* * *gigi 1024*1024*1024=1,073,741,824* * *tera 1024*1024*1024*1024=1,099,511,627,776 For giga the variant with 1024 is 7% larger than the 1000 variants The storage medium is sold with units using 1000 and it tends to be stated on the packaging and websites of the manufacturers Operating systems tend to use the 1024 definition.

I'll never forget it, he smiled and gave me one of those respectful nods. Even though I was starstruck I just gave one back. It was a human moment.

4.0,"ELI5: How can USB-C standard be updated to now support 240W power delivery when the plug size and number of pins don't change?[SEP]When two devices are connected, they negotiate power delivery. When a cable is plugged in, the power delivery pins are set to 5V, 2A, 10W. Then other pins receive a message that indicates the version of the protocol. In the first version, a device then sends a message that indicates which one of the five profiles to change to (the sixth was unused). These are specific power delivery amounts - 10W, 18W, 36W, 60W, 100W. The second version of the standard allows the device to select a specific voltage (5V, 9V, 15V, 20V), and then provides a way to fine tune the wattage from there. The messages allow 0.5W changes to the power delivered. The third version allows even finer grain control. The messages allow 20 mV changes to the power delivered. The fourth version, the new one, allows a larger range of voltages up to 50V to be selected. The other device has the opportunity to say it doesn't support the version requested. The devices will see if they both support each version, newest to oldest, until they can agree on a version or the basic 10W is used.",0,0,0,1.0,0

They include opening and closing parliament, appointing the PM, dissolving parliament, signing bills into laws, etc. The argument is how much power she has to wield those powers on her own. Could she just dissolve parliament, refuse to open it, not sign a bill into law, etc? There are laws that have been passed to limit how much she could but then that brings up the question of how would the courts rule if she decided to use these powers in a way that the parliament and their laws disagree with? So in reality she just does what parliament wants, waves to make the tourists happy and represents the UK internationally as a very hands off Head of State. She is also legally separately the monarch of 15 other countries which have their own laws on how she can act as their Head of State (or who in her place exercises her powers).",0,0,0,0,1.0

Example: the last time we reviewed my performance, it was taking me an average of 30 minutes to do each report. Since then, I learned to use X software more proficiently and I’m able to do a report in 20 minutes. That’s more than a 30% increase in my output. I realize reports are about 50% of my job requirements so I’d say using only that metric I am at least 15% more valuable to the company. I realize that I need to be a team player and provide value to the organization so I think a fair wage increase would be 10% and the remaining 5% efficiency will be an added benefit to the company.

It's that there is a speed limit to the universe, and light happens to travel at that speed (as does anything without mass). Basically, the constant 'c' is a number that came out of a set of electromagnetism equations known as ""Maxwell's Equations"" after the scientist who combined them, James Clark Maxwell. They are a collection of four laws that relate to things like how much electric field comes out of a certain amount of charge, how much moving a charge creates magnetic fields, and so on; examples include Gauss's Law and Ampere's law. These were all known before Maxwell's time from experiments. Maxwell showed that by mixing and matching these laws for a space with zero charges in it, you could describe a wave made up of electric and magnetic fields that wibble-wobble back and forth and travel at a specific constant speed (which is based on other constants that were already known from Ampere's Law, Gauss's law, etc.) That electromagnetic wave is light. The reason that nothing can travel faster than that constant speed is from Einstein's theory of relativity - when Einstein was doing thought experiments using Maxwell's equations, he found that you could create a situation in which, by putting an electromagnetic coil on a very fast moving train (close to the speed of light), Maxwell's equations said you could get infinite energy out of the system. Einstein reasoned that this was probably not how the universe worked - infinite energy should not be possible. As he worked through the math, which is all quite complicated, the only way he could resolve the problem is if nothing could travel faster than 'c' - it had to be the speed limit for the universe. So much so, that if there was something that WOULD go faster than 'c', time and space would have to bend themselves in unexpected ways to make sure that noone would be able to have an object travelling faster than c (which would allow them to get infinite energy).",0,0,0,1.0,0

Even if you’re super attractive and charming, sometimes in that environment that’s the last thing on someone’s mind, but still you didn’t even do anything wrong. That encounter couldn’t really have been drawn out without risking her getting uncomfortable or something or you saying something actually cringe worthy.

I’m not saying this is the foolproof strategy, as it may just work for me, but I think having some misplaced confidence can go a long way.

If monotheism is true, then there is only one god -- in the strict sense that there's only *possibly* one god -- so there's no worry (literally no *possibility*) that you could have proved the existence of a god but not the right one or the real one. &gt; The Pascal's wager fails if we allow the existence of multiple gods/religion...

Of course it goes deeper than that and is more complex, but there is a correlation nonetheless at least with Myers-Briggs typology. Intuition, at least from this context, is reading between the lines, connecting the dots, using trans-contextual thinking, and thinking ahead as to what might be. Please keep in mind that this definition may not exactly be what you're referring to, and I'm just talking about my observations in a very specific theory. From my experience it all stems around the perspective of the words ""what if?"" The phrase can mean what if something bad is going to happen that I cannot foresee, or what if the possibilities? People who worry more than dream, will often default to the first, and vice versa. This observation is most easily seen and people who use Si (Introverted Sensing: Detail oriented, good memory, in-tune with the present moment and the past) versus people who use Ne (Extraverted Intuition: Big-picture oriented, novel ideas, in-tune with the future possibilities and abstract thought). Si personalities include ESFJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, and ISTJ. Ne personalities include ENTP, INTP, ENFP, and INFP (It should be noted that in this theory there are two types of intuition, and I am only talking about one since there is a stronger connection to the topic and this type of intuition is also the opposite of Si, whereas the other isn't exactly opposite.

5.0,"ELI5: If photons have no mass, why are they affected by gravity?[SEP]Hi! In the theory of General Relativity (GR), gravity is not a force at all, but a curvature of spacetime. To understand how a curvature of spacetime can lead to the effects we observe around us, we have to understand how curved surfaces change the behaviour of straight lines. First things first: an object that has no force acting on it is force-free. Force-free objects do not accelerate and, therefore, move along straight lines. In a flat geometry, two straight lines which are parallel at one point will remain parallel for all times. That is, two parallel straight lines will never cross on a flat surface. So far so intuitive, right? But what happens, if those straight lines do not move across a flat surface, but instead along a curved surface? We call such straight lines on curved surfaces [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic). Imagine a [sphere](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/%7Edwh/books/eg99/Ch06/3776c40d.jpg) with two lines perpendicular to the equator. As they are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel at that altitude. Imagine two objects that are moving along the lines perpendicular to the equator. They start out parallel, and move in a straight line upwards. Despite the fact that neither of them is turning, the two objects that started out moving along parallel lines will meet at the north pole. Hence, despite the fact that both objects are force-free at all times, they experience relative acceleration. Such trajectories, that lead across curved surfaces without turning are called geodesics and they can be thought of as straight lines on curved surfaces. Objects under the influence of gravity follow [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic). As gravity curves spacetime, geodesics can experience relative acceleration despite the fact, that both objects following said geodesics are force-free. And this relative acceleration of force-free bodies is what Newton mistook for the gravitational force. According to GR, though, there is no force, only curvature which causes force-free objects to move along paths that seem accelerated to outside observers. This is why gravity is a fictitious force: The reason why two objects in a gravitational field may experience relative acceleration is not a force between them, but geodesic deviation between two force-free objects. **That is why photons are affected by gravity: photons follow geodesics through spacetime, and the presence of mass-energy curves spacetime. Therefore, the straight lines that photons follow through this curved spacetime appears curved to outside observers.** If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask. ----- For a great video on the basics of GR, check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NblR01hHK6U) video by PBS Spacetime.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: Why does wavelength affect diffraction?[SEP]This is a long one. TL,DR at the end. Preamble for context: To ask WHY a wave does anything is difficult, since a wave is more of a description of how energy is propagating through a collection of what I'll call ""points""† rather than a definite object. In Physics when we talk about WHY a wave does something we're doing a little bit of anthropomorphising of the wave. Usually this is okay, as it helps make some of the more abstract stuff go down easier, but in the case of WHY a wave's wavelength affects diffraction, it becomes problematic. This is because diffraction isn't a property of the wave, it's an emergent property of the wave-gap system as a whole. †could be transverse waves, or longitudinal waves, and could be through matter; molecules, atoms, etc., or it could be more Quantumy stuff like light that I could go into, but it would make this very much not ELI5-y Okay main answer: In this situation, it's best to think of a wave front (the horizontal lines on most diffraction diagrams - could represent the peaks or troughs of a wave) as a series of many individual wave SOURCES. That is, each point on the wave front creates new circular waves of the same wavelength, propagating outward. Re read that last paragraph and make sure you GET that idea. Search ""Huygens-Fresnel Principle"" on google images if you need some more visualisation. Don't scroll too far though some of the diagrams are weird and scary. The second diagram on the Huygens–Fresnel principle Wikipedia page is a good one imo. Okay, now just think about a single wave front that is right in the middle of the slit. ===----=== (if === is the opaque barrier and --- is the wave) If we draw circular waves coming from many points along that wave front, the physical wave that results (due to interference) is going to have a certain shape which is going to depend on how wide the slit is (or, technically on the distance between the first and last of our wavelet sources on the wave front, but assuming we've got a great number of them, the slit size is essentially equivalent). Again the Wikipedia diagram can help visualise this. Stop here and make sure you have that last bit properly visualised. Don't move on until you get it. Now for the more tricky bit. Imagine making the slit wider, and what effect that would have on the diffraction. Hopefully you can see how the diffraction is less pronounced as more of the wavelet sources contribute primarily to the ""flat"" portion of the final wavefront. Now do it the other way, make it smaller. Can you see that the diffraction is now more pronounced for the opposite reason? [obligatory visualisation checkpoint. Ihre Papiere bitte!] Let's assume the opaque barrier that the slit is in has zero width. There's no material that does this but the thickness of our barrier isn't something necessary to consider and makes the next bit trickier to visualise. Scale up EVERYTHING in our experiment. Make the wavelength bigger, the slit bigger, all of it. You've got the same situation right? Without a scale on the diagram, we SHOULD have no way to tell by how much we've made it all bigger. Now make the slit smaller (and let's assume you've done this such that the slit is back to it's original size, for simplicity). The first bit, scaling up the whole thing, has no effect. The second bit, scaling the slit back down, is the same effect as the second visualisation we did before the last checkpoint. Go back and have a look if you need to. Move on once you can imagine everything up to this point. So, what IS the difference between 'making the slit smaller', and 'scaling everything up but keeping the slit the same size'? The difference is the wavelength. And for our thought experiment, *only* the wavelength. (Other properties may have changed but these aren't shown on the Wikipedia diagram, nor have we been considering them, and wouldn't have an effect anyway) This is how to imagine the mechanism by which the wavelength affects diffraction; because the slit size can only really be measured *relative to* the wavelength and vice versa. Hopefully the first part of my answer helped you understand the mechanism by which slit size affects diffraction as well. As for why, like I said at the very beginning; the thing we call a wave is a collection of lots of points interacting with other points nearby, so to paraphrase Yoda, a ""wave"" does or does not. There is no why. Don't worry too much if you still don't really get it. Even Physicists don't really get it, and given that ""why"" isn't an easily definable question in Physics, you don't actually ever need to know why other than to satisfy your own curiosity. I'm happy to answer any follow up questions or clarify something if you need me to. TL,DR; Go and read it. The only TL,DR I can give is that you're asking the wrong thing. Waves just do diffract, and wavelength just does affect it.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It just so happens that a lot of people want to buy fresh baked goods, and the stores have the stock to do so. Plus, they set prices at a certain point that they can cover basic employee wages and potentially make profit - not too low that it discourages healthy competition, and not so high that people won’t come and buy the products as other locations offer similar goods for cheaper. It’s like any other business, really.

I feel like a good game soundtrack has the potential to be very easy, and very influential to the game in question. I think if you want a solid story-heavy, deep, and grounded game, the cello is a good instrument for this type of music. Also, light piano is good for relaxing and beautiful vibes. Storywise, I would probably make it set in the present, maybe a game based around abstract messaging. Like, games like hollowknight (I haven't played it, but I wish I had the game). I wouldn't go too heavy of graphics, but I would try to make colors and scenes interesting. Maybe, colors tell the story, idunno. Gameplay is where the game-type I'm describing falls short almost. To a certain extent, you need to give up story elements for the sake of gameplay, so maybe I would make it a platformer, due to the fact that jumping on platforms doesn't have to change the dynamic of the game. I wouldn't want to focus on a mulitplayer with this said project in mind as a blueprint. It wouldn't work as such.",0,0,0,0,1.0

For example, when you double-click an image file, the operating system looks up ""Who opens .jpg files? Oh...it's this Photos app."" In order for that to work, the Photos app had to tell the OS that it exists, what kinds of files it can handle, and how to ""talk"" to it. For most large software, the software is also using a lot of shared resources (both hardware and software) on the computer. Part of the installation process is the program figuring out what and where those shared resources are, installing any that are missing, and generally figuring out ""where stuff is"".

5.0,"eli5 Why sleeping just 30 minutes less during night, horribly affects my cognitive function and performance?[SEP]Probably because you're interrupting a sleep cycle. During an average night, you will go through two sleep cycles. Your brain will go into REM sleep, then fall into deeper sleep, bounce around for about 90 minutes at the lowest levels of sleep, then come back up for REM sleep and do it all over again. A whole sleep cycle takes about 3-4 hours depending on the person. If you wake during REM sleep, you will probably feel refreshed. Wake during one of the deep sleep phases, though, and you're pretty fucked up. It's a terrible analogy, but it's sorta like you tried to go into fourth gear from a standing stop if you wake from deep sleep, rather than going smoothly from third to fourth when waking from REM. So it has less to do with the total amount of sleep you got than with the length of your sleep cycles and when in one you are woken up.",0,0,0,0,1.0

They may seem intimidating at first, but as long as you handle them in a professional manner, you’re golden no matter the outcome. • If you feel like that job doesn’t suit you, please don’t stick around because they pay a certain amount or that you’re obligated to for some reason. It’s okay to find something you do have at least a little joy doing. • Kindness is key; even if you have a crappy coworker, a bad day, or a Karen customer, kindness comes in handy. Instead of scowling at the lady demanding a markdown on an item that doesn’t need it, smile and tell her to please wait while you get your manager. • This all being said, however, please also remember at times to stick up for yourself or be honest. If you are being accused of something you didn’t do, tell them that. If a coworker is being a dick, tell someone. You can be nice and also take care of yourself in those instances. I work at a retail store, so not all of these may fit 100%; I tried to be as general as possible. Bottom line: Be nice/polite, stick up for yourself if necessary, and be prepared (sadly not everyone is very nice and have a stick up their ass).",0,0,1.0,0,0

4.0,"ELI5: When you convert an MP4 to a GIF, why does the file size often become larger?[SEP]Video compression is based on the fact that most of the time the next image in a video is a slight modification of the previous. The result is that you start with compression of a complete frame and only store the difference to the next. The difference can include stuff like that part of the image moved in that direction a number of pixels. When the difference is large enough or if some set amount of free you restart with a new frame you compress from scratch. This is a lot more efficient than compressing each frame separately. That said animated GIFs are not a sequence of GIF images. It stores the difference from the previous frame but the way the difference is stored is not as complex as for MP4 and the result is larger files. The audio is a small part of the video so how efficient is compress the video part is a lot more relevant This is for real GIF, Today most GIF files are not really GIF files often it is WebM with a .gifv extension. The video format is VP9 if I am not mistaken. If it really is GIF the video only has 256 colors and will be a lot larger. So the explanation that it gets a bit larger is because you recompress a compressed video and even compressing to the same format results in a larger video. Different compression standard are have different efficiency It can also be a question of the setting of the program. You can spend more time and compress it to a smaller file with the same format.",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"Is the Categorical Imperative a method of morality?[SEP]Well Kant's answer would be that whether an act is universalizable is the question of whether it is a morally good action. And his reason for why this is the case is that for a person's reason for action to be permissible it must be a reason which all people could act on. And this matters because of the way Kant understands human beings as autonomous creatures, which can be good only if motivated by a good will. So if you take the CI by itself it might seem that it is not a test for moral goodness, badness, permissibility, etc, but Kant has reasons why the CI is a test about morality which he argues for in the Groundwork and elsewhere. You could also look at how these positions connect in the SEP article on Kant's Moral Philosophy, which does a good job breaking down the separate positions Kant takes on moral issues and how he combines them in his project. (Edit: Just want to note that this objection could basically be leveled at any moral theory, which might help you see where the question is off. Example: Utilitarian calculus only tells us how much pleasure/suffering an act creates, not if it is good. But the Utilitarian point in using that calculus is because pleasure is good, for which they offer arguments.)",0,0,0,1.0,0

A coworker and I goofed off alot because we finished our work fast and had downtime so wed use it to just joje and talk. One day we found a cart full of fruit and on the fruit there was a sticker price tag. I took one of the stickers and put it on my shirt joking about my worth to Walmart. At lunch one day I decided to try the sub shop down the road and inside there was a small line. The last couple in line, to my surprise was a highschool bully I had and his gf. This guy would make fun of people because of their looks, weight, activities, he got laid alot presumably, cursed at teachers, kicked out of class, laughed at you in gym class with his friends, good looking....you get the picture. We stood there awkwardly, the restaurant was relatively small so we were pretty close to eachother. He turns and sees me. He recognizes me and acknowledges me. ""What's up man"" he says with a smile ""how are you?"" Being polite and knowing this guy is a good reason for my social awkwardness and fear of being judged in public, I say ""Hey _____, im doin alright how are you?"" He keeps smiling and now his gf is looking at me smiling. I knew her aswell, though not very familiar with her, I say hi. ""Awww cmon man, you're worth more than that"", he reaches forward and pulls the fruit sticker off my shirt. I remember the whole restaurant went silent. I remember everything in slow motion, the smell of bread and pizza in this little restaurant became very pungent and I could feel the hot pavement from the parking lot still hot on my shoes. ""Haha yeah it's just a joke at work, I forgot about it."" He then explains his day and where he is working. The whole time he is talking, the line gets shorter and he gets his pickup order and leaves. I felt my face getting fuzzy and I felt like I was losing my skin. The moment was so awkward and uncomfortable and even had a touch of being pleasant. It was my first and so far only time a former bully was nice to me after hs. Not sure if he was just nice because his gf was there (not that he cared in hs, same girl) or what his deal was. But all in all, a weird experience. Saw him at an Arbys a few months later.

4.0,"How do you write someone singing / a song being sung in a story?[SEP]Is it playing through a stereo system / radio or is someone actually singing it? Usually when music plays in movies like that, it’s in the background as ambience, to contribute to the overall atmosphere. That is indeed kind of difficult to capture in a 2D format like books, you can’t get the full 360 degree texture that you would when you can engage your visual and aural senses. But this is how I usually I do it. Since the music in movies is often background noise, you don’t really need to put the actual lyrics in writing, because odds are that your characters aren’t paying that close attention anyways. Usually, it will do good enough to say that the character heard a song they recognized (maybe mention the name of the song), heard a catchy/sweet/sensual/bopping melody etc. Use descriptive words to capture the texture of the melody, the singer’s voice, and so on, as it would be perceived by the character If the song has importance in some way, then maybe you can insert the relevant portion of the lyrics, but like you say, you can’t really “hear” them, so it risks lessening the impact.

What do you think would happen?[SEP]There was this similar themed show in Hongkong and Mainland China years ago. They swapped billionare with bottom feeders, let the rich do the basical job, on the lowest salary, to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort. Nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere, regardless of how hard they worked, even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society. There was only despair, and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense. It stirred big debate among the society back then, and I think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled . There was also another show in China, swapping senior political figures with community level council workers, to see how good they could do in each other's posts. The mayors were flooded by the angry mobs who kept asking for more and more benefits that were impossible to fullfil, by the end had to admit the amount of work at basic community level was too much to archieve anywhere.

5.0,"ELI5: Why can't a sine and cosine angle be greater than 1?[SEP]Start with the unit circle -- a circle of radius 1 [in whatever units], centered at the origin. Draw this. Pick a point on the circle and draw the radius to it. Also draw the vertical line to the x-axis, and the horizontal line to the y-axis. The angle is measured from the positive x-axis counterclockwise around to the radius. By definition, the height of the point above or below the x-axis is the sine of the angle. Likewise, the distance of the point left or right of the y-axis is the cosine of the angle. Now, no point on the circle can be more than 1 from the center; the most the sine and cosine can be is 1 (or –1). What about bigger circles? Then the sine is the ratio of the height to the circle's radius, and similarly for the cosine. So, if the point is at coordinates (x,y), the radius is r = sqrt[x^2 + y^(2)] by the Pythagorean Theorem. And the sine is y/r while the cosine is x/r. Again, the magnitude of these ratios is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 1.",0,0,0,0,1.0

If I where an historian I would probably pay more attention to the cathedrals, historical building and so on. We are most likely experiencing the same world with our senses, but the models we have to interpret and process these sensory information can be quite different from one another. So while they live in the same world objectively, they might interpret similar experiencing completely different, resulting in very different way of seeing the world, so this objective view of the world can only get you so far. Some people believe they are separated from one another, others believe we are all one. The world is one, but we are seeing it very differently. The thing about philosopher is that they put a lot of effort trying to describe how and why they see the world in a specific way.

So you need to consider that. You also need to consider that 800 pages will put off a lot of readers (and agents/publishers) so if you go that route, you better make damn sure every word is necessary, because if your first chapter feels bloated, then people will just assume your book is long for no reason.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"1,000 page monster or 2 500's?[SEP]If you have the standard word per page count for a word processor, (about 500 words per page) a 1000 page book is about 500k words, which is really long for a first book. Publishers balance the cost of printing with the expectations of the audience to find a preferred word count for different markets/genres and books that fit within that word count are generally more likely to be published; particularly first books. When you are established you can get away with more. General and literary fiction is best aimed at 90k words, fantasy at about 150k etc etc. There are many websites and blog entries dedicated to the optimal word count for different markets. Therefore finding a way to get your manuscript to manageable pieces makes it more likely to obtain an agent or commercial publication. This can be done by editing down or by cutting up into pieces. The problem with that solution is that books written in parts have a different story structure to single novels. Each part of novel of the series needs to be a complete story in itself with a longer story arc that connects the books. In addition, if you are trying for commercial publication they will not, for a first time author, accept a book from a series unless the first book stands alone if they don't publish the rest just in case your first book is a failure. So you need a first book that stands alone and a series that can continue it. If you just broke your book into 2 parts you will have a first volume without any kinda ending and that will be pretty much unpublishable. This is why for commercial fiction it's best to have a reasonable page or word count in mind before you start writing and why if you have a big story that's too big for 150k words you need to have an idea for a structure to the plot that breaks it into parts before you write the first part.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: Why is Iron the boundary between nuclear fusion and fission. What makes it so unique?[SEP]That has got to do with the binding energy of the core. Now what is binding energy? It's essentially the energy that you need to break a core apart. Now why is that important, well one could assume that the weight of a core is the same as the sum of weights of it's consituent parts, but it isn't. The core is usually lighter than the sum of it's parts, which is call mass defect. Now according to Einstein and his famous formula E=mc², mass (m) and energy (E) are directly related through a constant (c=speed of light), so you essentially a difference in energy between the core and what you'd get if you break it apart. Which is aptly called the ""binding energy"". So it's essentially the energy that you get by having a core over having parts. Meaning the creation of the core released energy and to break apart the core you'd need to resupply it with energy. So if you look at the graph displaying the binding energy of cores per nucleon (parts of the core), you'll find this: https://opentextbc.ca/universityphysicsv3openstax/chapter/nuclear-binding-energy/ So if you take 2 hydrogen atoms (consisting of a proton and a neutron) with a binding energy of ~1MeV per nucleon and fuse them to make helium (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons or the the stuff in 2 hydrogens) then you realize that you went from 1MeV/nucleon for ²H to 7MeV per nucleon for ⁴He. So you start from 4 nucleons at 1MeV = 4MeV to 4 nucleons at 7MeV = 28MeV now removing the 4MeV to break up the hydrogens you get 24MeV of energy from that reaction. Consersely if you break idk U235 into Ba142 and Kr91 the difference is much smaller let's say U235 are very roughly around ~7.5MeV and the other two are very roughly ~8.5MeV than you'd get a ~1MeV per nucleon which sounds like way less but you'd get that 235 times. So as long as the result of either fusion or fission ends up having a higher binding energy than the stuff you fused or broke apart you would gain the difference in binding energy. However if you look closely iron is the core with the highest binding energy so both fusion and fission would require not provide you with energy.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"Deleuze's theory of desire - desire as a productive force?[SEP]It's been a while since I read ""Capitalism &amp; Schizophrenia"", so I don't know the lingo too well anymore. But this idea of desire as productive force is something very much in line with Deleuze's poststructural way of thinking, so that you can't really say ""A desires B"" as if desire was a relation between two separate, static subjects. It's more like that when A desires B, B gets constituted in this process, same as this desiring also transforms A. It's not like ""A produces an image of B"" - that's not what ""productive"" means for Deleuze (and Guattari) and that's why he's talking about ""reality"". In desiring A as well as B get transformed and bcome something other. Furthermore, one thing Deleuze emphasizes often is that you don't usually desire a specific thing, but a ""assamblage"" - meaning that what A desires in B is a manifoldness of processes (things that A associates with B for example). I'm not sure how this relates to the idea of productive force in Deleuze, but it should also relate to this non-structuralist idea.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: What is dungeons and dragons?[SEP]It is a tabletop role playing game set in a fantasy world. Players create a character, using a character sheet to record their skills and achievements and progress. There are different classes to choose from, like warrior, thief, mage, archer, and more. Each one plays differently. There's a bit of theater to it. One player is the Dungeon Master who creates and narrates the story that the other players are playing through. The other players, in the role of their characters, advance through the story. Unlike video games or other board games with really strict rules, D&amp;D encourages creativity and quick thinking, and you can go ""off script"" and do whatever you want to most of the time (as long as the Dungeon Master allows it). Probably the most famous parts of D&amp;D are the morality system (playing as a good, neutral, or evil character), and rolling dice to complete skill checks (say your character has level 3 lockpicking and there's a lock that is level 2, but you're drunk so your ability is impaired a little bit... you roll a dice to see if you're successful or not. This goes for *every* encounter in the game, from trying to persuade someone through speech to attacking rats with swords). If you've ever played a video game RPG, then it's most likely had some sort of D&amp;D mechanic implemented in it, especially the skill check system (though video games usually resolve this automatically for you). The most popular games that are based on/inspired by D&amp;D are the Baldur's Gate series, Neverwinter Nights and Pillars of Eternity, but there are many others.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Build a solid customer base (competitive pricing helps in this regard), invest, build your revenue without increase costs at the same rate (which is almost always the case) and now you're making profit.

5.0,"ELI5: I’ve always heard people in the US have iPhones on a “contract” and end up getting the latest phone as and when the contract ends. How does this system work?[SEP]That common system has changed in recent years... it used to be that you'd pay only a fraction of the true cost up front, and the 2-years contract for service would include the rest of the phone's cost baked in. Now, you can finance a phone through a carrier or Apple, still typically over 2 years, but it's separate from your service (which no longer carries a contract). So 7-8 years ago, you'd pay $200 to get a $800 iPhone, with AT&amp;T charging you $80/mo for service with a 2 year contract -- of which $25/mo went toward the phone's full cost, but wasn't a separate line item. Now, you might get a phone through them, but the $65/mo call/data plan is separate from the $40/mo phone financing.

4.0,"Those who are in a relationship with your s/o and are not married but one wants kids and the other doesn’t. It seems like that is a big turn off to those before marriage. Do you compromise or move on? How did you deal with it?[SEP]When I met my partner, I wasn't looking for anything serious and neither was he. I said I wanted kids, he said he didn't. Neither of us thought much of it. He had always wanted kids when he was younger but his most recent long term partner was against them. In that situation, he conceded and got used to the idea of never having kids. That opinion was quite strong when we met. I never tried to convince him to change his mind, and didn't really bring the topic up, but as our relationship progressed and he thought more about his options, he found himself wanting a family. This did not happen overnight. We must have been together 2 years before he tentatively started bringing the subject up as a possibility for us. We've been together 5 years, no kids yet, but he's almost more excited than I am now. I think it's very important to find out someones reasons for their choices, so you can better understand them.

4.0,"What's a great source/book/podcast to read/hear about Anarcho-Communism?[SEP]&gt;I wanted to read Kropotkin's Mutual Aid as a preface to the subject but it doesn't seem to be well regarded. I wouldn´t say that this is the case, atleast not amongst Anarchists. The thing with Mutual Aid is that it isn´t a source on Anarchism (the words Anarchy and Anarchism do not appear once in it) but instead more of a work that is meant to debunk certain ideas of human nature, it´s a book on biology rather than Philosophy. That doesn´t mean that the work isn´t important, if one wants to understand Kropotkin then they must also understand his views on human nature etc. to see were he is coming from. Surely many people will disagree with me but I´d say that reading the entire book is not essential (except if you are interest in late 18th-century biology or if you are interested in as many details of Kropotkins works as possible). Reading the Introduction and the Conclusion of the book (You can do that for free [here](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution))should suffice to understand the basics of this work. If however you are actually interested in the subject of the book and want a deeper look at it in the historical context I´d also recommend the dissertation [""The struggle for coexistence: Peter Kropotkin and the social ecology of science in Russia, Europe, and England, 1859-1922""](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0378937) by Eric M. Johnson. &gt;Wondering if there is any other place to begin or any other recommended material. For Kropotkins Anarcho-Communism I´d say that [""Anarchist Communism. Its Basis and Principles""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-communism-its-basis-and-principles) is probably the best place to start. [""Communism and Anarchy""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-communism-and-anarchy) is also decent. As a book the [""Conquest of Bread""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread) is usually the go to tho it´s not the best place to start with. Works that focus more on Kropotkins philosophical believes are [""Anarchist Morality""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-morality), [""Ethics: Origin and Development""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development) and [""Modern Science and Anarchism""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-modern-science-and-anarchism).

5.0,"ELI5: Why does the order of a resistor not matter in a series circuit?[SEP]Imagine you connect several pipes to supply water somewhere. The pipes have different diameters. The bigger diameter - the more water can fo through that single pipe in a period of time. I.e. speed of water (current) depends on pipe size. When connected in a series, the pipe with smallest diameter sets the limit for water flow speed (maximum current) for the whole pipe system. You can't make the water flow faster than it can flow through the smallest pipe The same principles are applicable for electric current. The wire is a pipe, the electric current (directed flow of charges, for example electrons) like a waterflow. The resistance is a value that depends on wire section area in inverse proportion. Also the voltage can be seen as a height difference between the pipe ends. If pipe is horisontal the difference is zero (no voltage), the water (and electrons) are not going anywhere. When pipe is not horisontal, the difference sets pushes water and electrons through the pipe (wire) and sets the speed (electric current strength, amperage). The sign of that difference (positive or negative polarity) sets the direction for current flow.

4.0,"ELI5: How does an automobile's gearing affect its torque versus its top speed?[SEP]If you've ever ridden a bicycle with gears you can get a really direct example of this. If you go uphill, it's REALLY difficult in a higher gear, in a lower gear you can peddle easily and get your mass moving but you'll have to peddle faster doing it. Same for a car, with the ""effort"" in modern engines being analogous to dumping in more fuel in an attempt to provide enough power until the point it bogs down or the torque converter just starts slipping. Conversely, you can only peddle so fast no matter how little effort it can take and engines can only run at so high an RPM. So if you're not trying to get up a hill, pull something heavy, whatever, that low gear will leave you spinning like mad but not getting anywhere fast, you've got to spin the tires more times to speed up and you can't spin the power source any faster so you change the ratio of power source spins to wheel spins, ie you shift into a higher gear. ""Overdrive"" refers to this ratio going beyond 1.0, meaning the transmission output is spinning more than 1 time, maybe 1.1 for example, for every rotation of the engine/pedals. Really fast cars need to have a high max RPM and hogh available gear ratios to avchieve those speeds while making enough power to fight things like air resistance, the rolling resistance of tires and the friction in the drivetrain. Cars also have a gearing in the axle, usually somewhere in the 3-4 ish range, which means that for every 3-4 rotations of the transmission output, the wheela will rotate once. This has the same relationship to speed/power as the transmission ratio. Numerically higher axle ratios (more driveshaft turns per wheel turn) provide a mechanical advantage for power, but require a higher RPM to achieve the same speed, all else equal. These higher numbers are seen in trucks, off road vehicles trying to fight the inertia of large tires, and drag vehicles where acceleration is prioritized over high top speed (up to a point of diminishing returns anyway). You'll also often see higher axle gearing in vehicles with the smallest available engine for that model since it allows the manufacturer to provide more mechanical advantage to the weak engine without having to build a different transmision with more advantageous gear ratios. Numerically lower ratios are seen in high cruising speed cars and in commuter vehicles that want to either maximize speed at a given RPM (optimizing for high cruise speed) OR that are trying to maximize fuel efficiency while cruising (lower rpm for a given speed means the cylinders firing fewer times means less fuel used). Gearing is always a trade off. You can only go so low before it's imptactically slow and demands way too high an RPM from the engine. You can only go so high before the engine can't produce enough power to keep the vehicle moving, it eventually needs more mechanical advantage from the gears to get the job done.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Both were for high school technician posts in the UK. One guy showed up wearing bicycle clips, a cape, and a hat with earflaps. He did remove the hat, but only when I firmly suggested it. During the interview told an irrelevant and very long story about his mother's pernicious anaemia instead of answering the question about his job history, and then gave us a lecture about diesel engines (also irrelevant). I didn't dare look at my fellow interviewer for fear of breaking into hysterics. He phoned for feedback on finding he hadn't got the job, which was an awkward conversation. That was the most bizarre. The other was a really nice guy, in his late 40s maybe, early 50s? Good job history of various manual posts. Interviewed really well, great verbal skills, was personable and completed the practical tasks brilliantly. Then the reading and writing task came up, and he just said no. It was simple ordering from a catalogue. I thought maybe he didn't want me to watch, so I went and made tea and left him to it, but he wouldn't even attempt it. Didn't even open the book. I think he couldn't read. When I looked at his application form, it looked as though it had been written by a teenage girl, and he had mentioned teenage daughters. Really sad. Mostly because if he'd said, we may have considered appointing him and giving him help, but he just refused to do the tasks, so we had to cross him off the list. That was the saddest.",0,0,0,0,1.0
5.0,"ELI5: Why does adding rocks, or rebar to concrete make it stronger?[SEP]It’s easier to understand the effect with rebar, because the effect is so pronounced and the materials are so different. Concrete is really good at keeping its shape and not breaking under compression, like if you were to push on either end of a block. If you were to pull on either end (tension), it wouldn’t be nearly as strong. The opposite is true for rebar. When you put them together, the weakness of the concrete in tension is balanced by the tensile strength of the rebar, and vice versa. The strengths of one offset the weaknesses of the other. You can go a step further by putting the rebar under tension before the concrete is set, so that when you release it, the slab is in compression. This makes it very strong, and is how most modern concrete structures are made.",0,0,0,0,1.0

It was a trickier one, I had a torch with me and was in proper clothes for it. I had to stay in one place and sit down and had a back story of an injury so they’d need to pitch up a tent around me, work out what’s wrong, which equipment and how to get it down there, and do the turn taking carrying me with it. He said that it would be quick to find me but the rest would be the hard part. I wasn’t supposed to verbally respond at all while they weren’t very close or use the torch unless it got past a certain time. I waited what felt like ages, it got dark. I hadn’t heard them calling out at any point. Despite what I was wearing, I was getting too cold sitting still. It was before the time allowed but I turned my torch on. I felt guilty about that. Nothing. Still nothing. I waved it around and started humming to myself, then singing to myself, then signing loudly. Nothing. I stood up, which would totally wreck the exercise as I wasn’t supposed to be able to stand. Nothing. I shouted and flashed the torch. I kept thinking about whether I should try to work out how to get back toward the car park or not. I wanted to, I knew it was at least uphill. I knew that was probably unwise because moving around would make me even more difficult to find because surely at least my boyfriend knew where I was, he’d said bye and left me there. The time for turning the torch on being allowed came and went. I didn’t have any signal, this was back in the day, I had a mobile phone but they were shot back then, you couldn’t just drop a pin. In the wee hours I heard distant voices and ended up screaming and yelling and flashing the torch at them and they were indeed mountain rescue. I nearly demanded we just leave but they wanted to do the exercise. I was so shocked that I agreed and we did it.

However he took it way to far, changing his appearance to look just like Barry Allen and even recreating the accident that gave him his powers. However since Thawe lived in the future long after Barry lived he decided to go back in time to meet his hero, resulting in him visiting the Flash museum of this time and discovering that he would become the Reverse Flash, the Arch nemesis of Barry Allen! That pushed him over the edge and he started to actually hate Barry and became delusional. **So essentially the reason why Eobard Thawne hates Barry Allen is because of a paradoxical time loop where he was already his Arch nemesis**",0,0,0,1.0,0

Talking about cheating and cheating aren't necessarily the same thing. Sometimes people can have moments of weakness but change their minds before they follow through. Once you know though that's it. It may ruin your friendship with your friend. But let me tell you this if they are unable to be faithful to their partner then I don't know if that's a person you want watching your back.

4.0,"Why would anyone accept that abstract objects ""exist""?[SEP]&gt; Surely a person who never heard about triangles wouldn't consider A and C to be more of the same class than A and B. Aren't classes just arbitrary regardless of how obvious or unobvious they might feel to our perception? People make mistakes about what class something falls into all the time, so there is nothing particularly significant about this. And besides, class-membership is something that we *learn about*, not something that is meant to be obvious, so if you stipulate that we're talking about someone who's never heard of triangles, then of course that person is going to be ignorant of whether some shape is a member of the class *triangle*. &gt; Can someone explain it to me in accessible terms? The simplest reason is that realism explains features of the world that nominalism can't explain. Therefore, it has more explanatory power.

4.0,"Is there a limit on what you’re allowed to research, or can you do what you want as long as it gets funded?[SEP]There are limits. They will depend on the institution you work at. Generally speaking, it is the university that accepts research grants, not you as an individual, and the university can decide not to accept the money you applied for if they don’t want to support that kind of work or don’t have the infrastructure to handle it. There are going to be a lot of regulatory issues, physical space issues, security issues, etc. around those kinds of work, and a university that has already solved those issues for other people doing similar work will have a much easier time agreeing to accept another grant. A university that doesn’t already do, say, cryogenics work is less likely to be willing to set up all the necessary facilities and processes just for you. This can change depending on where you are in your career. A well established and prestigious researcher can have a lot of leverage to negotiate when changing universities. A new researcher is unlikely to find a university willing to bend over backwards to suddenly develop an explosives handling program if they don’t have one already.",0,0,0,1.0,0

I was in 2nd period English, dreading the upcoming math test, when the entire school building just shook. Most of us thought it was an earthquake, which is uber rare on Manhattan island. The bell signaled the end of the period and I was heading to my next class when I saw a bunch of kids running up to the 5th floor. When I reached to the spot where everyone was, the North Tower was on fire and we saw the plane hit the second tower. The worst thing is that you saw like flakes coming off the building which later on, you realize those were people jumping or falling out of the building. School security came and brought us all to the school Auditorium. There was a huge line for the public phone as kids tried to call their parents. The school locked up their doors after NYPD came in to ensure no one comes in and out. I try to contact my parents but they didn’t picked up (my mom by the time, was walking home from Long Island City and my dad got sent home from Midtown. We were desperate for information and all we had was the radio station but they knew as much as we did. Then, all the sudden, outside our school windows, people started panic running up 6th Ave when a giant cloud of grey smoke just overtook them. When the cloud was gone, it looked like a Baron landscape. We were all stocked there to about 5:30p when the A, C, and E trains started running again. I got home to find my parents and sister safe. We were off from school for a week, returning back next Monday. Many kids didn’t came back since they had family members working in WTC. We started doing the Pledge of allegiance in class again (first time since elementary school). A lot of kids had a panic attack when Flight AA 587 went down in Queens a few months later, but it was just as bad as many kids in my school are Dominican and lost someone in that crash too.

It’s a really addicting survival game that you can play with between 1 and 10 players, currently have like 150 hours after playing for only like 6 weeks. The graphics are kind of what I call pretty PS1 graphics; not high def but gorgeous somehow. It was developed by only 5 people over the course of a couple of years. The music is wonderful, each area the music feels like it is tailor made for that area and evokes it’s mood real well. There’s also a ton of lore behind the game as well. It’s currently in early access on Steam, but don’t let that put you off, it’s better than quite a lot of polished, complete games on Steam. There are currently 5 completed, fleshed out biomes in the game, each with 1 boss that spawns exclusively in that biome. There plans to add further bosses and flesh out each of the unfinished areas currently in the game. Each world is randomly generated using a random seed, like Minecraft, but you can enter in your own seed if you want something specific (close bosses, far bosses, good starting island with resources or not). I’ve only played on a randomly generated seed and if you’re just starting out, that’s probably the best way to avoid spoilers. You can also just build shit and not worry about the story. The game’s building mechanics are pretty forgiving (if you destroy something you get back all of the materials used to build it) and you can build pretty amazing shit, if you’re willing to invest time to gather the resources required. It takes a bit of getting used to, but after that the sky is the limit. The best thing is how free you are to do what you want. I’ve heard of people playing 100 hours plus and not leaving the starting biome, just building up gigantic home bases. I’ve heard of people speed-running this game, trying to beat it as fast as possible. I’m in between, probably leaning more towards playing to try and beat each of the bosses in the game at a reasonably chill pace.",0,0,0,1.0,0

A 27 year-old man does not develop a romantic interest in a 19 year-old girl because they're impressed with how ""mature for her age"" she is, or because she is the ""pick of the litter"" out of all the females in his circle. He spends time with her because she's easier to impress, not much of a challenge, and makes him feel good without having to put forth much effort. This may not be the greatest analogy, but suppose you're hungry, really hungry. Would you rather make whole-wheat biscuits from scratch, or just pull the wrapper off of a cupcake and wolf it down? Of course you would eat the cupcake. Biscuits aren't difficult to make, and a batch of whole-wheat biscuits would last you all day and be better for you, but like most of us, you go with the easier option. A 19 year-old girl diesn't ask a 27 year-old man to clean the trash out of his car, get a job, talk nicer to her mother, or stop peeing in the sink, all things a woman cliser to his own age might request.

5.0,"ELI5: Do banks owe each other cash to compensate for account-only transactions?[SEP]The first thing to know is that paper money, likely what you refer to as ""cash"" is a very small proportion of the money in any bank or banking system (or country for that matter). Most money in modern banking system is electronic - it only exists as numbers in a computer. No country prints out paper money equivalent of the money available in their economy. So there is no real issue to resolve here and, no, banks don't need to cart around pieces of paper from location to location. Bank A simply electronically transfers funds to Bank B and vice versa, as required. Banks do loan each other money though. The reasons for that are more complicated generally. Banks are required (by law) to maintain a certain money ""reserve"" in their accounts at the Central Bank in accordance with their deposits and loans. At certain times, banks may require more reserves and some banks have excess reserves of money. They will borrow from each other usually for very short periods (like overnight) just to maintain the required amounts.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"Republic, 333a-e, how close does Plato get here to discovering the dual value of commodities in this passage?[SEP]&gt;However, because the determination of value had never been discovered at this point, he seems to find it hard to see the mutual property between the horse and the money which would require the horse-seller to be truthful in his determination. After all, it would be entirely possible for a man skilled in horses but not in justice to properly know the value of his horse and deliberately give a higher price. Therefore in a purchase and sale, both the particular understanding of the object and an understanding of justice in general is needed, but this conclusion is not reached by Plato. I don't know anything about Capital - but I can't help throwing in a comment regarding reading Plato. I think you should pause to consider this question: What is more likely? It actually never occurred to Plato that someone could be dishonest and overcharge someone else. Or... Socrates is using a deliberately flawed argument to lead Polemarchus to a certain conclusion (namely, that justice is not worth very much, and it consists in lying and stealing) for a certain reason. \[It seems obvious to me that the latter is more likely. Indeed, I would argue that the whole crazy argument (which culminates in Polemarchus being forced to agree that justice is lying and stealing, the exact opposite of what his father Cephalus had asserted) is deliberately flawed and designed to highlight the way in which justice is not one art among others. Justice is normative and thus a ruling art, determining how the others arts should be used. That's the point you're led to, if you think through the ways in which the argument is flawed. The argument thus foreshadows the rule of the philosopher kings, who rule the other artisans in the city based on their knowledge of justice and goodness.\]",0,0,0,0,1.0

Go to a community college if you can. Teach yourself with study guides and YouTube videos. Get a certification if it's applicable. Write up a resume. Send it out to as many places as you can. Cast a wide net. When you get a bite and if they ask you to come in for an interview, show up on time with good hygiene, neatly dressed (you don't need a 3 piece suit, just khakis and a polo with no scruffy hair or scraps of food in your teeth), and a good attitude. When you get a better job, give your shit job 2 weeks notice (ghosting a job is like setting a landmine for your future self), and keep saving.

It probably works at least as well as water would, and water and scrubbing will get most things clean.

5.0,"What is the dumbest thing that someone did at your workplace?[SEP]I worked at a dermatology office. We had a receptionist who was very sweet but not very smart and often made little mistakes just because she didn’t understand why they were mistakes. Her vocabulary also was not too great, and she would absolutely say “dick” instead of “penis” in general conversation (though I think she would say “penis” if needed in conversation with a patient, that never came up). This is relevant. Well one day I’m working and preparing charts (I started visit notes before patients would come to make charting easier) and I notice a woman is on the schedule for a spot check appointment for “spot on ____/pussy discharge.” (I don’t remember where the spot was- probably back or arm or leg). All day I’m thinking, well we aren’t gynecology, but maybe there is a cyst on the vulva, or maybe it was one of those “and also” moments, which we got a lot. Many providers in the office were female and would check the vulva, labia, and even inside the vagina - surely the receptionists would let the patient know we might not get to the “pussy discharge.” Even still, it’s a weird thing to put for a medical clinic. But again, kind of expected for the receptionist. Patient comes in, and upon intake we realize the issue. It wasn’t meant to be read as “pussy discharge.” The spot check was a wound with “pus-y” discharge. The receptionist didn’t know the right words to use- purulent or pustular wound in this case. She felt awful but it was also hilarious.",0,0,0,0,1.0

Easy listning glam rock! - [To the mountains - Big Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHOP41lWdE) If you like blues rock this is a banger, and could qualify as uplifting in one sense if the badass factor of the track is uplifting. - [Bohemian Like You - The Dandy Warhols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU3mc0yvRNk) A favourite of mine, you'll probably know it already if you grew up in the 90s/00s. Catchy and fun track! Woo hoo hoo! - [Bulletproof - La Roux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk8eJh4i8Lo) Girl power vibes.

5.0,"So has anyone tried fanfiction as a writer or is it a waste of time?[SEP]If you’re writing it for fun, go for it, but fanfiction as practice for writing something publishable later isn’t necessarily the best idea imo. For one, the audience is generally less critical than the audience for original fiction and *much* less critical than editors or agents. For the other, a lot of the heavy lifting you would have to do in original fiction—like creating characters and making the reader interested in them—is already done for you, so you won’t likely get better at that part of writing fiction with fanfic. That said, Sherlock Holmes is kind of a fringe case with fanfic since it’s technically in the public domain so long as you’re pulling from the Conan Doyle stories and not later adaptation like the BBC *Sherlock* or Robert Downey Jr movies.

Schopenhauer himself said the will is the cause of all human suffering, it's an inextinguishable fire that burns from the inside, through the entire duration of our lives. It might be sad to realize that suffering is unavoidable but you may also learn to take it easier.

4.0,"ELI5 : Why do we get irritable when hungry ?[SEP]Successful life-forms evolve reflex behaviours where they react to states of potential harm in ways which tend to act to reduce the potential harm. Lacking nutrients is an example of such a state of potential harm. A state of irritation is a state where the life-form is energized to act in certain ways (e.g. foraging for food, escaping a hostile situation) which are likely to reduce or avoid the potential harm. By contrast, a state of quiescence or passivity is a state where the life-form is ""de-energised"". It comes about as a reflex reaction to certain conditions in which being quiet, still and/or saving energy tend to reduce or avoid the potential harm. Sadly the reflex behaviors of humans are often not well-tuned to their modern societal environment and this often leads to negative outcomes. For example, getting irrtated at, and abusive to, the staff in a restaurant generally does not mean that your hunger will be satisfied more quickly.

The end result being a a little beear cub, after you have a few beear cubs, they mate and youre swimming in the honey!

Is not changing the fluid actually some mechanic secret or is he just stubborn?[SEP]If he's an experience mechanic and this advice comes from his own experience, he should be able to briefly explain why changing transmission fluid is a bad idea. In fact one would expect he'd enjoy explaining it. If he can't or won't explain why this is, then most likely he learned it from someone else whom he respected, or else he had bad experience with a narrow range of transmissions some time in the distant past. The truth is that automobile technology has come LONG way in 40 years. In fact it has come a long way in just the last 20. Manufacturers state the maintenance intervals for a reason, they don't just distill the maintenance schedules from thin air. If you can't get any info out of your dad, I'd ask your regular mechanic when or if the car is scheduled to have the transmission fluid changed, and whether they have any opinion on the matter, and go with whoever has the more convincing story. Edit: a couple of other points come up if you search for ""don't change transmission fluid"" on the internet. (A) if you wait until long after the scheduled fluid change, then changing it later may stir up the accumulated sediments, distribute them around the transmission, and cause a failure. (B) an experienced mechanic can look at the fluid that's in your transmission and tell you (by its color, viscosity, and any sediment present) whether it's past due for a change. The normal way to avoid this is to change it on schedule; and if you don't follow the schedule or if you never change the fluid at all, the transmission will likely fail sooner than its design lifetime.",0,0,0,1.0,0

My sensei started to change how we trained in the dojo to pander to new students. We used to train traditionally. It is very hard and you get hurt often. Not long enough to take you out for very long but it happens sometimes. Learning to handle to pain was part of the training. (For example: early on for my yellow belt test I had to fight 3 people at a time for two hours. He kept switching people out so I would keep being suprised. The aim was survive, and not submit. Then I had to fight my way up the belts. The aim was the same. I did this after dislocating my toe earlier. You learn to deal with the pain, just like in a real fight/survival scenario.) But people stopped coming because they thought it was too hard. He was losing business so he changed how we trained. I understand that he had to make money to support himself but I felt we were losing our way. Our students were not as skilled as they once where. I felt I wasnt getting the same training as I used to get. So started working as a ppo and debt collector for not so nice people and used my art to complete jobs. My sensei found out and told me that I was dishonoring our dojo by using dark martial arts for something other than self defense or protection of others. I thought he had dishonored our dojo by changing our traditional ways to pander to new students who didnt want to learn the traditional way. We disagreed and I left. Now I realise he was right. I was young and foolish and I was hurting people for money, that was dishonorable. But I am still upset our dojo has abandoned our traditional ways.",0,0,0,0,1.0

While I see it on the job most often, it can happen with anything that's stressful, from parenting, hanging out with certain people, large projects, and yes, job hunting. Burnout symptoms include but aren't limited to: * forgetfulness / hard time concentrating * loss of motivation / unable to cope * irritability * less healthy personal relationships with friends/family * pain, fatigue, insomnia Lots of things can be done to help alleviate all this. First, is time away from the stressor. I know you want/need a job, but you may need to take a break from job hunting to help you destress and refocus. Next, things like self care can help as well: eating well, exercising, trying to sleep on a good schedule. It's okay to feel good about yourself, even if it's hard to see things that way -- your worth as a person isn't determined by your employment status. Last (but this is not an exhaustive list), worry about the right things -- try to prioritize a bit more (not everything has to be done with the same urgency). Can you offload anything?

4.0,"ELI5: What causes increase in saliva during running?[SEP]So, the study you linked actually DID find an increase in saliva flow rate with exercise, but that was in CONTRAST to previous studies that had found saliva flow to be *decreased* or *unaltered* by exercise. (The water component of saliva is normally secreted during RECOVERY / non stressful type stimuli, aka your parasympathetic nervous system, while proteins such as amylase in saliva are normally secreted during STRESSFUL type stimuli, aka your sympathetic nervous system.) Since they weren't expecting that, and it wasn't the main objective of their study, they weren't really ready with an explanatory discussion of that result. The best they gave was that the exercise environment was kinda cold (10 degrees Celsius, which is 50 degrees Fahrenheit) which could have stimulated saliva flow, and that they were exercising in that relatively cold room for only 20 minutes and ""under these circumstances dehydration is expected to be limited."" Usually, the general explanation is that it's not so much an increase in saliva as it is an increase in the THICKNESS (viscosity) of your saliva, which feels uncomfortable in the mouth, and so we are more aware of it and more motivated to spit than usual. The increased viscosity is usually thought to be caused by the dehydration of your oral tissue from evaporation during heavy mouth breathing, but the study you linked above shows an alternative explanation, which is the increased production of MUC5B - a mucus-making protein - during exercise. (They noted that this was counterintuitive, since MUC5B is usually secreted during parasympathetic response, aka recovery and not stress, but again since this was an unexpected result they don't have a super strong explanation for it yet.) The purpose of mucus is to catch unwanted matter in your airway and glom onto it, so that it can more easily be moved along up and out of your airway (ideally cough it out). There is mucus in your lower airway, which is super important for protecting it, but your salivary glands also produce mucins (mucus-making proteins) as well. The study you linked above found that when you exercise, your salivary glands make much more of multiple different proteins, so the protein concentration of your saliva goes up. This is probably due to your glands being stimulated by substances that get released in your body during stress (exercise is definitely stress, to your body). One of those proteins is the mucin MUC5B, one of the guys that determines how viscous (thick) your saliva is. This study found that MUC5B concentration increases with exercise, which is another explanation for the increased viscosity of your spit and therefore the need TO spit. Tldr: it's more that the viscosity increases and makes you feel the need to spit it out. New evidence suggests flow may also increase but not super clear on why yet.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Really you divide up into three things: teaching, mentoring, and research (+ service and administration, but let's ignore those). Mentoring is the one that really is ambiguous here. I've been a professor for 12 years at an R1 in STEM. I'm on a 1/1 (one course per semester), though 2/1 is more normal for our department. Since I've taught everything a few times before, this usually is a one-day-per-week commitment between lecturing and grading. That gives me roughly 4 other days in the work week to do non-teaching. I do sometimes spend more days per week than that, but I have the luxury of being tenured and taking things easy now. Most free time (4 days/week) is spent on mentoring and writing. Mentoring is a good split of both- it's teaching, and research. Given my time outside of mentoring is mostly writing, this mentoring is the route by which we produce research. I get into the lab somewhat infrequently, but more often on some occasions (summer, for instance, is ongoing now, and so I will go in to set an experiment up or use the equipment a few times). I'll meet with my grad students/postdocs usually 1 or 2 times a week. I help address problems, decide what to do next, and help interpret data. I also check in on their writing progress. Where I'm at right now, most of my time is more valuably spent in writing, usually proposals and papers. These fund the lab directly and indirectly. Writing is still research and uses brain power, but it's not the joy of setting up a successful experiment or getting a key set of data.

5.0,"How to stop being obsessed by a girl?[SEP]TL;DR: She liked the attention you were giving her. She was stringing you along. I commend you for telling her how you were starting to develop stronger feelings, but she didn’t pull away fast enough and part of me thinks she didn’t because she truly enjoyed spending time with you because of how it made her feel. But then she realized that she could jeopardize her own relationship with her fiancé and then self-preservation kicked in and she pulled away. It sucks to feel used by people. You weren’t attached and she was. She told you that you were her ideal guy, and in turn you showed her more attention and developed stronger feelings. The fact of the matter is this: if you could find another girl who you were attracted to and to whom you also felt a connection, you would forget about this girl. Let her go, for your own sanity. The other fact is that you’ve realized that you have some obsessive qualities, but she definitely stoked the fire and brought those out of you with little regard to your feelings. There is a lesson to be learned here and it’s now your job to work on how quickly you get attached. You can’t control your romantic feelings, but you can avoid people and situations that will not be in your best interest (like spending time with an unavailable woman, or at least pulling yourself back once you realize that it’s heading in that direction).

5.0,"ELI5: how did the roman empire/prussia/idk became modern germany ??[SEP]The Roman Empire was never particularly solidified in what was then called Germania. The vast majority of the people living there were the ethnic predecessors of what we would call Germans today. After the Roman Empire fell, Frankish tribes centered in Gaul (what we now call France) started extending their authority and rule into Germania and held all the land up to the Rhine. A few hundred years after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Moors began to invade Europe from North Africa through Gibraltar and into Spain. They conquered most of Spain and invaded France. They were doing well until they were defeated at the Battle of Toulouse by a Frankish military leader named Charles Martel. Charles Martel's grandson was renamed Charlemagne and made the Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire was comprised of all the lands held by the Frankish people, including those in Germania. Other powers arose in France and warred with the Merovingian and Carolingian Franks for control of various parts of France. By the middle ages, France was no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire, which was now mostly just Germania. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 due to the Napoleonic Wars. Regional powers like Prussia had become stronger than the empire. Now instead of the Empire, there were the various German states, which came together in 1815 and organized themselves as the Confederation of German States. That would go on to become the German empire, which was defeated in WW1 and made into the Weimar Republic, which saw the rise of Hitler and reorganization into the Third Reich, which was defeated in WW2 resulting in democratic West Germany and communist East Germany, which reunified in the late 1980s as Germany.",0,0,0,0,1.0

On top of that, you should consider the fact that it may be confusing to you as well. I personally prefer writing in first person and I find it extremely hard to maintain the third person.

4.0,"How do I start my meditation journey?[SEP]Mindfulness is a good way to “practice” - for example with a walking meditation. Don’t bring your phone! Or use headphones. Instead, notice what you are experiencing in the moment. Maybe the warmth of the sun on your face, and you notice the sensation of that, then you notice sounds- maybe birds. Just notice anything that comes into your awareness. Welcome it in, there it is, and then release that thought. The next will come. Alternatively you can walk and put all your awareness on the sensation and act of walking. Notice how your feet hit the ground, how your legs feel, toe, heel, forward, weight on the ball of your foot, are you leaning, just step , step , step , step. It’s 100% normal to just start with however much you notice - whether that’s 15 seconds or minutes. You can’t get it wrong.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: how do successful restaurants run?[SEP]General operation of restaurants When your order is taken it's put into a computer which has software that breaks that order down into component parts. The kitchen is broken down into ""stations"". The exact delineation of the stations (how many, what they are responsible for, etc) depends on the cuisine, restaurant size, etc, but as an example you might have: a fry station, grill, saute, someone assembling salads and deserts. These stations may be staffed by one or more people. Each station has a defined set of responsibilities that make up the whole of a dinner. So when you order that aged prime new york strip with asparagus and a béarnaise sauce and crispy pomme frites, it gets broken down into multiple tickets, each routed to the specific ""station"" that needs to cook it. The grill station knows they need to grab a new york strip and cook it medium rare, the sauté (usually the guy in charge of the kitchen that night) knows to broil some asparagus and plate it with béarnaise sauce, and the fry station knows to drop the fries in the fryer. The real key is timing this all out, sophisticated kitchen software can help with this, but even with paper tickets a good chef can articulate the timing and a well practiced team knows it anyways. The order comes in at 8:24pm, grill knows the steaks are done in 11 minutes, asparagus done in 12 minutes, and fries done in about 15 minutes (béarnaise is probably already done and just waiting to be sauced). So the fries are going in immediately, but saute and the grill might wait a couple of minutes to time it closer. As elements get done they are often passed to the expeditor or expedite line. It's basically a station, often with the primary serving dishes and garnishes, where the various independent elements from the multiple stations are combined on a plate in a pleasing manner. The person filling this role can be a variety of people (including someone working at another station like the saute chef in smaller kitchens) but the point is, there is usually one person who assembles all the elements together, does a final quality check, and makes it look nice before a waiter takes it (think Gordon Ramsay in Hell's Kitchen). As you can imagine, in order to efficiently operationalize a kitchen you have to be thoughtful of the ""how"" it gets made. The example above involves 3 different stations and the food comes out pretty close to each other. The most labor intensive part is probably the béarnaise but, as noted, that can be made before kitchen service begins and just sits warm for the night. For things that take a long time to cook, there are often tricks you can use to kind of ""stage"" the food until later before opening for service. For instance baked potatoes can largely just sit in a warmer in tinfoil waiting to be used, Standing Rib Roast you can cook below rare and then just slice a serving off and quickly ""warm"" it to the desired level of doneness, in-house pastries and bread goods are made that morning (the pastry chef is often walking out, done for the day, around when everyone else is just showing up to work). You don't want to overprep but with history (and again, ordering software can help with this) you can get a pretty good idea of how many baked potatoes you go through in an average Friday night and plan accordingly. If it's unusually busy at 7:30 you might try to prep a few extra incase you get walk-ins at 9:30 and you think you might be low, but in some cases restaurants just accept running out (if it's that late). Pricing is easy. If you do a good job designing the menu and train your kitchen staff competently, you know exactly how much our example meal costs. There's some variance in portioning (it's possible to get more or less asparagus or béarnaise sauce) but keep in mind these people cook this meal over and over and over. If you can retain staff they get practiced enough that portions and cooking gets consistent as well. As a result you can keep food waste usually pretty small. Some items are more sensitive than most, frozen fries aren't going to be wasted, but fish isn't going to last very long. For nice restaurants using fresh ingredients you'll frequently see specials, stripped down menus, and changing menus to accommodate for that. Too much asparagus? Well it's not just a side dish anymore, let's maybe do an asparagus tips salad (and cut off the now woody ends), that'll at least trim our potential food waste down. Ordered some bluefin tuna? You'd rather run out by Sunday night service than have some left Monday morning. For less nice restaurants (think franchises) they're going to lean away from fresh ingredients at risk of spoiling. Glancing quickly at TGIF's menu, their seafood consists of fried cod filets, various forms of shrimp, and two salmon dishes (one heavily sauced) that I'm almost positive come to the store frozen. That's how those chain restaurants get away with such sprawling menus, it's all designed to not be sensitive to spoiling and having to be tossed (heavily saucing things is a way to hide this. Lots of sauces/glazes promote a restaurant feel because home cooks don't want to fuss with the effort while simultaneously doing a good job of covering up mediocre proteins that are frozen so you can keep food costs and waste down).",0,0,0,0,1.0

4.0,"How do i challenge rationality??[SEP]You're asking about pretty much the entire modern era of philosophy &amp; epistemology. Kant's ""Critique"" is probably the big daddy when it comes to the subject, but definitely not an easy place to start. I can point you in some directions to get you there, and if you're interested in the books with them, the articles supply multiple options: * Ancient Skepticism (as an introduction into modern epistemology) - [Sextus Empiricus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-ancient/#SexEmp). * Modern Solipsism - [Rene Descartes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/#NewMet). You'll probably want to read his meditations. * Modern Rationalism - [Baruch Spinoza](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Know). I'm not a fan of rationalism so feel free to skip, but it's good for context. * Modern Empiricism - [David Hume](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#AccMin). As a scientist, I'm assuming you'd be more interested in empiricism than rationalism. * Transcendental Philosophy - [Immanuel Kant](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/#KanProThePurRea). His critique of pure reason is key on your question If you want a brief run of how all of these go, it's pretty much: ""You can't know anything for sure"" -&gt; ""You can know that you exist for sure"" -&gt; a spicy argument between a bunch of guys arguing whether rationality necessitates external experiences (i.e. our senses) -&gt; There is the stuff you can't know, the stuff you can know, and there's the stuff we inject into the unknowable so that it can be known by humans. Kant basically came in while everyone was bickering, invented a whole bunch of words, blew everyone's minds and then sent the modern era of philosophy on it's way. [Schopenhauer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/#3) critiqued and clarified a lot of Kant's work, and [Nietzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#PoweLife) really just took epistemology from a cultural sense and leveraged it into his Will to Power.

A lot of people don’t even make it to this point. Second, I highly recommend reading (at your own pace because some of this stuff may be triggering) about abuse and manipulation, just to understand general trends and how it impacts the abuser and the abused. Many abusers were abused themselves (and you’re right it doesn’t excuse your actions, but can provide some insight). Be self reflective about why you think you do specific behaviors and then when you’re ready, I think speaking to a therapist would help rewire your tendencies to healthier habits. Try not to berate yourself too much. If you’re in college, there should be resources for you on-campus. (It’s my go-to recommendation for getting help without your parents knowing and for free, but I can only speak for the US.) Third, growing from this won’t be a cut and dry thing.

5.0,"What is hands-down the best date you’ve ever been on? Who were they? What made it so special? What did you do?[SEP]When I first met my ex-girlfriend we were working together doing summer stock theater in a little town in New Hampshire called North Conway. Summer stock theater is both incredibly intensive and like a theater summer camp for adults. At least this summer was. We had a strange start to our relationship and it was supposed to be a summer thing only. About a month into hooking up we decided to take a day trip on one of our few days off and go to Portland, Maine to visit this hole in the wall seafood place that Anthony Bourdain said was amazing. I had no idea who Anthony Bourdain was at the time, I just liked to eat, but she was really into food and experiencing food. You know how people say that you should always travel with someone before you marry them? This was like a mini version of that. We hopped into her car and started driving, she had made an incredible mix full of music I had never heard before. It was hot and we were cruising with the windows down and the music blaring, laughing and talking about anything and everything. We took a few wrong turns, but it just made things more fun, not more stressful. We finally got to the place, J's Oysters, right in the harbor, snuggled up against the docks full of lobster boats. The whole night was incredible, we ate steamed clams and then had lobster, and had a few drinks and other appetizers. The food was absolutely incredible. Some of the best seafood I've ever had, and I grew up going to Maine every year to visit family. It felt like we were the only two people in the entire restaurant. We were there for a couple of hours, slowly eating and drinking and laughing. I absolutely, 100%, fell in love with her that night. I've never felt that comfortable with anyone, before or since. When we had our fill, we took a walk around Portland in the cool summer night with the breeze off the ocean. Then we drove back to North Conway, with the windows down and the summer breeze in our hair, holding hands and laughing and talking the whole way. We climbed into bed and fell asleep naked with the fan on and the window open, listening to the sound of peepers. By far the best date I have ever been on. We ended up being together for 7 years, and to this day she is one of my very closest friends.",0,0,0,0,1.0

The heart, lungs, arteries, veins, and capillaries are like a pump and piping system for your body. Their job is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all the cells of your body. When this system functions well, your body and all its cells are happy. When you lay around all day you tend to breath shallow and have a low heart rate and blood pressure. This means your circulatory system isn’t pumping blood around your body super effectively. Oxygen and nutrients aren’t getting into all the nooks and crannies as well as they could be. This stagnation makes you feel lethargic and weak. You might notice that if you haven’t exercised in awhile and you suddenly go for run you might get all itchy, particularly on your thighs, butt, and torso. This is because the increased activity is forcing blood into capillaries and activating nerves that haven’t been used in some time. This is also why stretching, massage, and heat is good for recovery and injuries. It increases blood flow to the affected area and helps the healing process. There are other psychological and physiological reasons but those are more complicated. Overall, your brain and body is happier with exercise and good blood flow.

I do think you're expecting too much from yourself if you're expecting your first written work to be objectively good. Even studying beforehand will not prepare you sufficiently. You don't get good at writing without actually writing. A *lot*. I've heard ""five million words"" thrown about as a figure but I suspect this differs for everyone. Writing is a skill. It requires practice. Nobody sits down at a piano for the first time and plays Chopin flawlessly, no matter how much they've studied beforehand. Fingers on keys: that's what matters. The good news is that you're 44k words into your total, and that is a really amazing achievement! Seriously! Every word you write is pushing you towards your goal of writing A Good Book. You're on your way. The other good news is that nothing is stopping you from writing this trilogy, then writing a few more books, *then* coming back and editing your trilogy so it's objectively awesome, the way it deserves to be.

Someone added me through a messaging app, it was 9pm, insisted on wanting to give me a ride like on a late-night date or sth. I took the offer since he wont shut up (stupid I know). After evading his offer of taking me to some shady coffee shop, I told him I wanted to go to the local bookstore which he agreed to. He gave me a ride with his motorcycle (a VERY common vehicle where I'm from). All throughout the trip, I had google maps open on my phone in one hand, and in the other was a cutter I brought with me in a pocket. To my surprise, he did bring me to the bookstore. Come 10 pm, the bookstore closes and I told him I just wanna go back. Again with the google maps and cutter combo. But this time, all the way back to my flat he blabbered about offering me to sleep at his place (which is 30mins from the bookstore, my flat was 5 mins from the bookstore). I kept declining, he kept insisting, saying things about taking me to see the sunrise in the nearby tourist spot. I got so fidgety with my cutter it might poke him a bit through my hoodie pocket. He asked, ""What was that?"" I just stayed quiet until he dropped me off at my flat. I don't know what got onto me (maybe the adrenaline from the whole thing) but I managed to gather the courage to wave goodbye at him with my hand still holding the cutter. He went away so fast and still has the balls to text me, ""You're a woman, why are you carrying stuff like that?"" I blocked him and deleted the chat. That was almost 2 years ago.",0,0,1.0,0,0

Color is speculative and scientists will mostly look to nature to find answers. Reptiles and amphibians are a good start and this is what was mostly used in the past. Large mammals like elephants, rhinos and hippos were also used leading to the idea that dinosaurs would have been mostly drab, consisting of earth tones (the first three Jurassic Park movies come to mind when thinking of this). Once the link between dinosaurs and birds was established and the discovery that many dinosaurs had feathers science started looking at birds for color inspiration. Many modern depictions have wild patterns and colors similar to birds. Personally I would think it's somewhere in between; some probably had striking colors and patterns while others were probably more drab.",0,0,0,0,1.0

5.0,"ELI5: What makes mathematics factual?[SEP]It depends what you mean by factual. All math is based off of things called “axioms”. These are essentially statements that you just assume are true, without any proof. The axioms used for modern math are put forth by [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory). Generally, axioms are picked so that they make intuitive sense, like saying that if two things are made up of the same stuff, they are equal (although some axioms needed for math might be less intuitive, like the axiom that infinite sets exist). In any case, everything else in mathematics is proven by using these axioms. As a quick detour, let’s go over mathematical proving. Let’s try to show that 1 + 3 == 2 + 2. Well, first we can use some addition rules (which can be proven with set theory axioms) to make 1 + 3 into 4. Now we have 4 == 2 + 2. We can apply those rules again to turn 2 + 2 into 4 to get 4 == 4. From here, we can see that the set on the left side is made up of all the same elements as the set on the right. Using our earlier axiom, if two sets are made up of all the same elements, then they are equal. Assuming our axiom is correct, 4 == 4 is therefore a true statement, which means that 1 + 3 == 2 + 2 is also a true statement. Again, this is all assuming that we treat our axioms as true statements as well. All of modern mathematics can be proven in this manner, just using the axioms given by set theory. Of course, it usually takes much longer. A good half of a book was dedicated just to proving that 1 + 1 == 2. **Edit:** *u/komandanto_en_bovajo has pointed out that a lot of that half-book was dedicated to setting up mathematics in general, and not just proving 1 + 1 == 2, so my previous statement is misleading.* Anyway, this means that, if you agree the axioms from set theory are factual (go ahead and read through them and see if they make sense), the rest of math is also factual, since you can show that the rest of math is just a consequence of those axioms. *As a side note, nothing is forcing us to use those axioms, except that most people agree they make sense, and that they haven’t led us to any contradictions or illogical outcomes yet. We used to have different axiom sets, but those eventually led to paradoxes, sort of like the mathematical equivalent of saying “this sentence is a lie”. We refined our axioms to get rid of those contradictions, but ZF set theory could still have some that we haven’t found yet. Anyway, nothing’s keeping anyone from deciding they want to make a better math and making their own axioms, except that ZF seems to make the most sense as of now.*",0,0,0,0,1.0

3.0,"Emotional toll of not releasing work regularly?[SEP]It's not an uncommon sort of incipient block. You're probably hoping you'll be great and admired for the greatness, or afraid people will notice your mistakes, and it's twisting you up. Thus the ""tossing"" feeling. Try not to feel either of those ways. Try not to think about the future. Stay in the moment. Just write, often, quickly. In so doing, you'll pile on the words, and more words mean more skill, and A+ work will come from that even if what you're producing now is solid B work. Once I was good enough to be commercial published, and when I switched ten years later to self-publishing, where releasing at least every 3 months is crucial to keeping your audience excited, I realized, ""Good enough is good enough."" It became one of my writing mantras. No more endless revisions. Get it done, get it pro proofread, and let the audience decide. At worst, you'll hit your stride one day and decide to take down the old stuff because you're doing much better now. Or, at worst, I suppose you'd need a new pen name because the old stuff was truly gawdawful people were traumatized by it, but that's highly unlikely. Still, one could do that too, and leave the embarrassing stuff behind. Write at least 1000 words per day. Study the craft somehow. (read how-to books; do close structural analyses of your favorite books; find a great summer workshop; whatever.) All else will follow. Try sprints. When it's a Nano month, they run sprints on their twitter feed. There are sprinting groups out there on the web. You write fast, and outwrite your self-conscious feelings that way. It's pretty easy to get 2000 words per hour in 10- or 15-minute sprints. Writing should be fun, not angsty. I get to make shit up for a living and work naked if I want.

If their value became more stable it totally could be. Right now is the time to invest. Not day trade gambles, invest as in ""I think this coin has long term potential"" place 100 dollars in it and leave there for at least one whole year before you ever consider selling.

Their point is that you should not be able to see through them or at least not very well. So transparent vails kind of defeats their point. The reason you can see features which is hidden under a vail is because these features deform the vail wherever they touch. The sculptors just need to make the vail lay as it would on a real person and these features will show. They do have the advantage of being able to put the creases where they want, adjust the posture of the person under the vail as they want and make the wind blow the vail in the direction they want which can exagregate this effect by allowing more features to show then normally. But they are still only shaping the stone to the vail and is not making the stone itself transparent.",0,0,0,1.0,0

4.0,"Does hardship make a person stronger? If so, under what condition and at what point is it too much hardship? If not, what makes a person stronger?[SEP]Hardship doesn't make anyone stronger. But learning how to cope does. But I definitely dislike the whole idea the strength comes from the hardships because either it came from stable surroundings you had before the hardships came and which made you prepared and more resilient or from the resources you managed to discover during and despite the hardships. Cruel times itself don't have any positive effect, they only hurt and weaken a person. But the idea that there's something good coming from them creates a climate where people live with the strange believe that people 'fail' during difficult times by searching for help, that they are somehow weak because hey, hardships are a chance for growth! They make you stronger if you just push through. And that's just utter nonsense. Its also harmful because it leads to people in distress not asking for help or too late and avoid therapy and other nonsense because they somehow feel that this would be a form of failure, that they have to endure and solve hardships all on their own to become somehow stronger. When I finally accepted help and got therapy the hardest thing was to understand that true strength means knowing your limits and search help when they're reached. Also that there's more wisdom and strength in acceptance than in denial. Sometimes I feel as if that notion is used by people who don't have many hardships to weasel out of giving help when asked.

That's not at all clear. You *can* always say that, but the strength of an inductive argument varies from case to case, and so the plausibility of the induction would vary from case to case. To make this more concrete: I've (verbally, not in print) argued in the past that we should almost certainly take various hypotheses relating to climate change (e.g., that it's caused by humans) to be even better confirmed than they seem to be because of how extraordinarily powerful the economic factors arrayed against accepting those conclusions are. (Similarly, I think there's a prima facie argument to be made that for a lot of people resistance to the science relating to GMO crops is rational given that GMOs benefit large food corporations and we know that large food corporation have in the recent past run disinformation campaigns to convince people that their products are healthier than they in fact are. Particularly for someone who doesn't have the time or training to go and read the scientific studies, it does seem to be rational to doubt that GMO crops are actually safe.)

4.0,"What seemingly unconnected events are actually connected? Why?[SEP]This is out of my own observation, so if it's wrong - it's wrong, but I believe Dragon Ball Z had a strange hand in helping revive Family Guy from cancellation: Back during the Toonami days on Cartoon Network in 99', they would air DBZ during the daytime around early afternoon, to a then new generation just coming into age for this show. At night, they also aired the next day's episode at 12:30 am, and I think the Cartoon Network ratings moderators caught onto that their ratings were starting to peak at this time, and realized kids/teens were watching in the early morning hours, in this case, just to see ""The Next Episode of Dragon Ball Z!"" so they introduced The Midnight Run starting around midnight of Toonami Shows from earilier in the daytime. Eventually, they changed it into Adult Swim and started airing more mature shows, like Cowboy Bebop, Space Ghost: Coast to Coast, Sealab 2021, Aqua Team Hunger Force, etc., and eventually got the rights to show reruns of the, at-the-time-cancelled Family Guy. The ratings I believe began to peak when it was on, and not too long after, the show was revived on Fox. There was even a short 'thank-you' animation short that aired on Cartoon Network from Peter about getting this show revived. I don't know if this is fact, but all-in-all, it's how I remember it, so whenever I see DBZ, I always think how it helped get Family Guy back on the airwaves in a strange butterfly effect, sort of way.",0,0,0,1.0,0

5.0,"ELI5: What exactly does it mean when a problem is NP complete?[SEP]A problem is NP complete if: 1. It is solvable, even if the method to solving it is no more advanced than ""Guess all the possible answers and see what fits"" 2. It is easy/fast to check if the problem was solved without going trough the effort of solving it yourself. 3. You can transform the problem in to any other equivalent NP-complete problem. What the other commenters are saying isn't *strictly* correct, because they are assuming the solution to a famous unsolved computer science problem: that P is not equal to NP. The set of P problems are any problems that can be solved quickly The set of NP problems are problems whose solution can be verified quickly. It is an open question if these two problems are the same: that if you can verify the solution to something quickly you can also find that solution quickly. While nearly all computer scientists believe that this is *not* the case no proof has been found.",0,0,0,0,1.0
4.0,"ELI5: How do companies that focus on space make money?[SEP]You can group what we learn from our adventures into space into 2 really broad categories. 1. Solving engineering problems in space (or space adjacent) often results in stuff we can use on earth. Space presents unique problems for engineers to solve and a lot of times those unique problems and solutions turn out to be really useful for us on earth. Probably one of the biggest things is the CMOS sensor, in other words digital cameras. Another is artificial heart pumps used in surgeries. We could develop them because of the software NASA uses to simulate fuel in rocket engines. This has permeated our society, pretty much all technology you use today got advanced in some way or form by NASA and NASA-related work. 2. Basic research. This is stuff that expands our fundamental understanding of the universe, which in turn lets us create new technologies. Sometimes this doesn't turn into something useful for decades or even centuries. Remember, technology at the end of the day stands on the shoulders of giants. Humanity has known about electricity for centuries. But couldn't really use it for a lot of things for a little more than a century. Today we literally could not have modern society without it.

5.0,"To all the teachers, how do you around eagerness in your students (University level) for improving their grades? Because we don't know their personal lives enough to motivate them to try harder, how do you motivate students to try harder in class? How can you arouse eagerness in them to try harder?[SEP]I’m an elementary-certified teacher studying for my senior highschool English credentials right now. This is a question we talk about all the time. I personally think it comes down to what we ask our students to do, and how much support/scaffolding we offer. If we assign tasks that feel meaningless, and confusing, and we aren’t checking in along the way to see how they’re doing/offer support, and we’re not explaining clearly how to succeed - enthusiasm is going to be low. If we assign tasks that feel meaningful, authentic, and connected to students’ lives, and if we ensure that success criteria is clearly understood by all - enthusiasm is going to be higher. If we can offer them a choice at any point, this helps too. Choice can be in terms of what we study, as well as what products the students produce. For example: “We’re going to do a poetry unit. Find any poem you like, or any poetic lyrics from a song you like, and have them ready for us to read and discuss together on Monday.” Or “For your final assignment you can do a PowerPoint, an oral speech to the class, or a formal paper.”",0,0,0,0,1.0

Take a game that is 10 years old and ran sluggish on high-end hardware when the game was released…. Run it on today’s high-end hardware and it’s effortless. Games often target what they think will be “current” tech, several years in the future. Since AAA games take years to develop, they have to forecast where tech will be and develop to that. They also want to appeal to mass-market so optimizing helps them sell to a wider audience since not everyone wants to buy new hardware or may not be able to afford it.

I stopped to help - the driver was conscious but barely, and I stayed with her until the ambulance arrived. I was late to my interview and told my interviewer why, but I was fully aware as I said it that it sounded like a total BS story that someone would make up to try to impress the interviewer.

If you can't, don't make a commitment that you can be there for them or else they will probably feel betrayed or lost and panic when you don't respond immediately. If you can commit, let them know if they have the urges, you can be there to talk to them. Do set boundaries if you work or have school so they understand you may not always be available.

5.0,"ELI5 How can you transcode media to higher bitrates when there is no new information to be included?[SEP]You can run the transcode job and set the bitrate very high no problem. You're right in that the image quality won't be any higher than the original input (without something modifying the video in between, but we will ignore that). However that doesn't mean the bitrate you request is impossible. The encoder doesn't know what the source is. It just gets a bunch of still images in a row and needs to encode them into a video file. It looks at them and does its best to preserve all the details it sees. Now some of those ""details"" will actually be the errors and artefacts of the lower bitrate decoded version, but dammit, it's going to preserve them as best it can! All the bits that are available to it will be used to make the new output look as close to the input it was given! For some types of video - like a cartoon with very little motion and a lot of stills - you might not reach your requested bitrate. The encoder does reserve the right to say ""I've done my best, higher bitrates won't help"". However that point can still be way higher than the original input. Also don't forget multiple codecs exist. I might convert from codec A to codec B. If codec B is worse than codec A, yeah it's going to need more bits just to not go to crap relative to what codec A can do. An original master source would be preferable to the codec A file I have, but sometimes you make do with what you have.",0,0,0,0,1.0

So much so that when I got accepted into graduate school, I didn't believe I could do it because I was ""too awkward"" and didn't have the ""right"" personality. Counseling helped me become more comfortable with being myself, and I am now a medical provider. Because of my experience I am now a huge supporter of counseling no matter how big or small your worries may seem. They would never make you quit the things you love. Especially if those activities are getting you out and being social. Counseling is about being your best self, not changing who you are. I would like to mention though that sometimes it might take a few tries to find a counselor that you really find works for you. After a few weeks if you don't feel comfortable being open and honest, it's totally okay to try someone else!

So just pick a dosage that will work for the vast majority of body masses that is also safe to take. Its safe and does the job so theres no need to look into catering dosage management for wildly different bodies. For more serious medications with serious risks (aka prescribed medication) - dosage does matter purely to reduce side effects and to be effective for what ever ailment the person has. This is one reason why some meds are over the counter - their high safety tolerances for the dosage offered and tends to work for most people. So no need to have multiple dosage options.",0,0,0,1.0,0

Another thing to consider, is that there are Authors and creative writers out there that are making ends meet, despite not being a household name.
