5.0,"Gamer girls, what are your experiences when gaming with males?[SEP]Most males have found it refreshing that I’m there to play and have fun, not to be that girl who flirts with everyone and begs/expects to be given items for having boobs. They’re very welcoming and respectful usually. My only issue was some gender bias in WoW. I was a tank in competitive raiding guilds. I always wanted a new guild I applied to to parse my previous raids and see some video before joining the voice chat interview portion. Sadly, too many males thought I should heal and not tank simply because I have a vagina. /shrug. Showed them... Top 100 US isn’t half bad, boobs or no boobs haha!"
4.0,"How can I deal with loneliness in a healthier way?[SEP]Journal!! That’s the best thing ever. Not everyone needs to know your thoughts, and you dont need to tell everyone, everything. From my personal experience, the more you tell about what you want, the good things happening and the bad, it goes downhill. Rarely are people genuinely happy for you and vice versa. It’s better to be low-key, do your thing and be happy. Also, I’m confused with the question vs your caption. They seem unrelated?"
3.0,"Offset panda: is it a scam?[SEP]I went to the only website I could find, and it seems sketchy. 5\* reviews, only 5\*. nothing else, and on similar dates. Their products also cost a heck of a lot less than amazon, but i guess i dunno. They also have sections in their website that don't have any products, it weird. [https://offsetpanda.com/](https://offsetpanda.com/) (this website)"
3.0,How would most people actually react to an apocalypse?[SEP]most would probably all hurry up and buy all the toilet paper and dogfood their 2005 Toyota corolla can fit.
4.0,"How has photography changed the world?[SEP]It's added perspective by allowing people to see things they simply couldn't perceive before. Freeze-frames of a bird's wings in flight. The motion involved in a raindrop landing. What distant galaxies look like. Also, there is at least the possibility of being able to objectively prove that someone committed a crime by producing a picture of them doing it, so trials don't have to depend on how trustworthy witnesses are nearly as much as they used to."
3.0,What song hypes you up?[SEP]The Pirates of the Caribbean theme music.
3.0,"People with an ex-lover's name tattooed on them, how does your current partner deal with seeing it every day?[SEP]My girlfriend does not mind. She only sees it when she is railing me with the strap-on. The tattoo is a memory of the time I spent behind bars."
1.0,"When using toilet paper which one do you do, Scrunch or Fold?[SEP]Remember that lady on First Dates NL who _opened_ with that line?! Right at the bar. Before even introducing herself. It was cringe af. There was no 2nd date."
4.0,"What is the most absurd thing you read on a company’s policy?[SEP]Idk if this counts but one time I went to interview for a job as a blackjack dealer at a nightclub and they asked me to take out my nose ring. (Of course I understand if it’s a job in the medical field, or if you have to take it out for safety reasons, etc. but. A dealer at a nightclub? I would have looked so cool, fucking fight me.) This was not that long ago, either. 2017? Maybe? We also had to pay for our own uniforms. Needless to say, I sent a text as soon as I left, saying I was no longer interested."
4.0,What was the worst addition to a good show?[SEP]A character added in just for diversity sakes which has no purpose and isn't believable.
4.0,"ELI5: why do we open our eyes wider when surprised or scared?[SEP]Surprise or fear are part of the universal microexpressions which are innate. On the other hand, a simulated reaction or emotion can be socially learned through imitation. However it might lack certain tells, if the corners of your eyes don't wrinkle up while smiling for example."
3.0,"Being drunk is the closest we'll ever come to being immortal. What story comes to mind when you hear this?[SEP]When I was young and dumb, I drove my car home from the bar when I really shouldn't have. Wrapped my car around a telephone pole before rolling down an embankment doing about 60 on a backroad. Not only was I ok but after I crawled from the wreckage I managed to run full sprint through the woods to a friend's house. Turned myself in the next morning. I got charged with leaving the scene but no dui. I got sentenced to 1 day of community service."
5.0,"To Teachers Who Had Students Attracted To Them, (And Did Nothing Gross And/Or Illegal) What Was Your Experience With Such Students?[SEP]I guarantee if you're under the age of 40 and you're in teaching, you have had a kid crush on you. Usually multiple, if you're in teaching for a bit or move schools. Some teachers let it go to their head, but it's completely ridiculous to believe this somehow verifys you're attractive. Teens go through such a weird time, they'll crush on anybody they're around for too long. I've had two who made it particularly noticeable. One used to follow me to the bus stop every day (before I bought a car) and one used to be an absolute pain in lessons, so they'd get attention from it. They would occasionally ask me inappropriate questions. They would smile the whole time I was telling them to concentrate. They also bought me chocolates at Christmas, which was a particular moment of horror. In both cases, you distance yourself. I started walking to a different bus stop, and we actually got the other kid moved into another class when we did a set reshuffle."
3.0,Why do you agree or disagree about there only being 2 genders?[SEP]Sex and gender aren't the same and they never have been
4.0,"What video game is really frustrating, but worth it?[SEP]Dark souls series. Totally unforgivable game, gives you no help but is very addictive."
3.0,What is a wrong thing that society thinks is normal?[SEP]Society doesn’t *usually* think this is normal. But any sort of racist/sexist views. We literally can’t choose how we are born on this earth.
4.0,"What did your crush do that made you more interested?[SEP]She cornered me, said ""what's wrong, I've liked you for a long time and I know that you like me too"" and she kissed me. And after that It was safe to say that that's all she wrote. lol"
5.0,"What happened after you told your friend your unreciprocated romantic feelings for them?[SEP]We were in high school and by the time I was a senior, I had the ""friend speech"" committed to memory. We went to different colleges and over Christmas break went to see a movie. On the way home, she commented that she'd probably find someone at her school to marry. It was the final knife through my heart. I gave up on her and started dating a girl where I was going to college. It wasn't a good relationship and I wasn't happy, but it did have one side effect......it bothered my friend. She later admitted that it shouldn't have bothered her if we were indeed just friends like she had always claimed. So the good news is we got together after I broke it off with the other girl. The better news is that we've been together now over 30 years."
4.0,"Teachers why are you guys so cool?[SEP]Because knowledge is the best thing you can share. If I have 20 dollars, and I give you 10, we both have 10 dollars. But if I know 20 facts, whether they are about science, history or whatever, and I tell you them all, I still know them. We both have those 20 facts in mind. And if you want to give money, you can only share the 10 dollars I just gave you, definitely less than I originally had, until the amount of money gets eventually smaller and smaller. But you can share those 20 facts around you exactly like I did. We are, as individuals, limited in our physical means in how we can help each others. But not in knowledge, as it costs pragmatically nothing to learn something to someone. Education makes us smarter, able of greater things, and ultimately improve the human condition. And changing the world for the better, that’s fucking cool."
5.0,"ELI5: How do analog signals (magnetic tape in particular) work?[SEP]It’s varying levels. Think of a photograph on film, which is functionally infinite resolution as far as human eyeballs are concerned (you can’t see any pixels). With magnetic tape, you feed a varying electric signal to the write-head of the tape recorder and it “writes” an equivalent magnetic field to the tape. When you run that same tape past a read-head later, the magnetic field of the tape re-creates the same electric signal (after amplification). There’s actually no difference between analog and digital here...all tapes are physically analog. It’s just a matter of how the reading machine interprets the electrical signal. If the electrical signal coming out is a copy of what came from, say, a TV camera, then you feed that output signal to a TV, then you recreate the image the camera saw."
1.0,"People who carry around a towel with them, why?[SEP]So everyone knows ""that's a frood who knows where his towel is""."
3.0,"To Architects, How Much Math Is Required In Your Job?[SEP]For Context: I'm a Year 11 Student (16 y.o) having to choose A-Level subjects, I originally wanted to become an illustrator but my parents said they would not support me financially if I chose to. Rather they are opting for me to learn Architecture. They are both engineers and claim that they can help me, though they couldn't even help with my O-Level homework. My worry is that I've recently dropped off in math (previously being an A-B student), at best I can get a B, at worse I can get Ds;; I understand that's not necessarily an F, but I really wish to excel at what I do; I'm anxious to take A-Level mathematics so any insight on that would be help as well. Honestly any insight about Architecture be it requirements, workload, etc. is valuable; I have very few non-biased, first hand sources."
5.0,"What’s touristy thing have you been so excited to see but it was a total let down?[SEP]Not a *total* let down, but they don't let you REALLY get in and explore the ruins at Chichén Itzá, you pretty much stay on a path and walk through the temples they've reconstructed and point out the piles of rubble where more used to be. It was still worth seeing and a great trip, I just really wanted to climb the temples and experience the views the ancient Mayans would have had. It's understandable why they don't, though...people are scum and would probably trash the place"
4.0,What is your favorite gaming moment?[SEP]the time i beat doom eternal on Ultra nightmare
3.0,"What latest phrase or slang annoys you every time you hear it?[SEP]Periodt - what the fuck does that even mean? ""I could care less"" - that doesn't even make sense. EDIT: typo"
5.0,"What is an accomplishment your younger self would be surprised you achieved?[SEP]I was a ""quite girl"" when I was younger with few friends and a lot of social anxiety. I'm 23 now and even though I still get anxious, I'm more open and push myself to make friends everywhere I go. I feel more free and I'm 200% happier than I was when I was younger. I'm pretty proud of this change and hope younger me would approve"
4.0,"Are there any songs, where the title isn't in the lyrics?[SEP]Smells Like Teen Spirit. Funnily enough, the album's title is in the lyrics, just not the song title"
4.0,"What are some tongue twisters you know?[SEP]Italians have a tongue twister that goes ‘’se l’arcivescovo di costantinopoli si arcivescoviscostantinopolizzasse, voi cittadini di costantinopoli vi arcivescoviscostantinopolizzereste come si è arcivescoviscostantinopolizzato l’arcivescovo di costantinopoli?’’"
4.0,"People who have gotten to the front of theme park lines, then had to go back, what happened?[SEP]A few years ago me and a buddy went early to cedar point over in Sandusky Ohio. He had a season pass so we were able to go in the park at 8 am as opposed to 9. The first thing we did was get in the line for the biggest coaster there the top thrill dragster. The line was normally 3-4 hours but we thought we were getting a steal having to only wait 2. So time goes we are looking at the front of the line now and suddenly it stops moving. The last ride we saw go off had a loud pop to go with it. After hearing this technicians knew something was up and shut the ride off. Me and my friend were determined to get on the ride but after 30 more minutes we knew we had to make a decision. We had to cut our losses and had to leave the line only 3 spots away from riding. Hindsight this was a very good decision since we walked by hours later in the day with the ride still broken down. Moral of the story don’t be afraid to cut your losses even if it means losing a lot of time."
3.0,What’s your favorite type of frog?[SEP]Banjo frog. Bonk bonk

3.0,What is the best comedy series on Netflix or Amazon Prime?[SEP]1- Brooklyn Nine-Nine 2- Brooklyn Nine-Nine 3- Brooklyn Nine-Nine 4- Brooklyn Nine-Nine 5- Brooklyn Nine-Nine Edit: Terry Loves Yogurt.
4.0,"Recommended next Stephen King book after It?[SEP]11/22/63, not only is it one of the best things he's ever written, but it has a nice Derry tie in."
4.0,Who here would rather be 60 and a millionaire or 40 and dirt poor?[SEP]60 and a millionaire. My road to make enough money for retirement at 40 from scratch is not an easy one. So I would rather toss another 20 years on and be a millionaire.
1.0,People with hairs sticking out large moles. Why don't you cut them?[SEP]Why cut when you can pull?
5.0,"What are the most interesting nicknames you ever got called?[SEP]Aquaman. My friends and I climbed through a hole in the fence of an abandoned skate park. This was early 80's, skateboarding was a short lived trend in the 70's and this park was a relic of that. At this point the only people that skated were punk rock kids. Anyway, the low spots had pools of water in them, this was early May and the water was pretty cold. My pals were much better skaters than me and wanted to have a contest. Being new I declined but they insisted everyone compete (not in a mean peer pressure way, just very supportive). When it was my turn I headed straight towards the water, leaned back and did a sprawling board slide into the H2O. My pals laughing, tossed their boards in the air and conceded. One of them had a fanzine and wrote a review of the competition in which he called me Aquaman. I'm going on 55 and to this day there are friends that call me Aquaman."
5.0,"ELI5: Why is it significant that Ingenuity was the first helicopter flight on another planet?[SEP]117 years ago the Wright Brothers were the first to take flight on Earth. One week ago Ingenuity, a NASA drone helicopter, became the first to take flight on another planet. This flight represents a new beginning for deep space exploration. According to [NASA](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Quick-Facts), the purpose of testing Ingenuity on Mars is to explore the feasibility of helicopter exploration on other planets. The most challenging part of exploring other planets is the extreme terrain, such as mountains, valleys, and caves. Our current rovers lack the capability to venture into these terrains, and because of that we lack knowledge about such formations. Imagine the view from a plane 30,000 feet in the air, compare that to what you see walking down the street. From the plane, you can see hundreds of miles across Earth and all of its contours. This sight advantage would aid in planet exploration, especially in astronaut navigation because helicopters can [""scout interesting areas ahead and relay images of the landscape""](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00909-z). The successful test flight on Mars proved to be an immense engineering advancement as the mission was full of [unknowns](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight). According to [this NASA fact sheet](https://mars.nasa.gov/files/mars2020/MarsHelicopterIngenuity_FactSheet.pdf), Mars’s atmosphere contains only 1% as much pressure as Earth’s, and the gravitational pull is only one-third the strength of Earth’s. Due to the lower air pressure on Mars, it is harder for a helicopter to create lift with its rotor blades. To combat this, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) designed [two 4-foot-wide (1.2-meter-wide) rotor blades](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight) that can create the lift needed to fly this device. Another thing engineers had to overcome was the time for radio signals to travel to Mars and back. The radio delay made directly piloting ingenuity impossible. Instead, Ingenuity was flown [autonomously](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00909-z), similar to a drone. Leaving no room for errors in its software as this world surely lead to an expensive failure. This is just the beginning of aviation on other planets, NASA plans on testing its [85 million dollar](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2021/04/12/nasas-85m-mars-helicopter-is-about-to-attempt-flight-on-another-planet-for-the-first-time-ever/?sh=3e1edec51226) helicopter in baby steps. Ingenuity’s [first flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMnOo2zcjXA) only saw the helicopter rise 10 feet above the Martian surface and hover for about 30 seconds. The [second flight](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8930/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flies-faster-farther-on-third-flight/) saw it rise 16 feet and then traverse 164 feet at a top speed of 6.6 feet per second, traveling far enough to exit Perserverence’s [camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNx9hcrUpww&amp;t=5s) view. While these may not be thrilling maneuvers, it is still just the start. Two more flights are planned to further test the capabilities of Ingenuity. This mission proved it is possible for a controlled helicopter to fly on another planet. This accomplishment will pave the way for future helicopter missions on other planets. TLDR: Ingenuity proved it is possible to fly on other planets with current technology"
4.0,"What's your airline horror story?[SEP]I had flown from California to Vancouver and had to catch a connecting flight to Penticton to see my family. My flight at LAX was delayed half an hour which some how translated into being delayed getting to Vancouver by another I guess 30 mins or so because of boarding and we sat on the runway for 800 years. I get there and the line up to get through customs is about 20 miles long, got through surprisingly quick considering but by that time I had to get ALL THE FUCKING WAY ACROSS THE AIRPORT in 15 mins and get through another security check on that side to make my flight, there was another line....thankfully the lady at that security was very nice and let me skip ahead but I asked no less than three other people to call the gate and let them know I was here and I was hauling ass and NO ONE would help me. There wasn’t even any of those luggage cart guys to beg for help. I made it to the gate just as the gate attendant was closing the door and she did let me run out to the small plane and board but she didn’t let me through without a snotty “This is why you’re supposed to be at the airport early.” I almost cut her throat on the spot. The kicker??? My luggage got lost."
2.0,"It's said that we block traumatic events from our memory, what could you have forgotten?[SEP]I rather not remember it’s blocked for a good reason"
4.0,"What statement/opinion do people tend to push as fact with little to know evidence?[SEP]The whole ""Humans only use 10% of their brain"" thing. It's been pretty widely debunked in pop culture now but I remember seeing that everywhere about 10 years back. It's just so absurd, like, why the hell would we have this dense, delicate, energy-consuming organ bobbing around on our shoulders if we never use it. Like sure not every neuron is active at the same time, but not every pixel on your screen is lit up simultaneously all the time for good reason."
5.0,"What is your favorite childhood snack you still eat today?[SEP]those cookies. Literally, google ""those cookies"" I don't buy them frivilously, but around holidays, if I'm meandering through the store, and they're on a display stand somewhere... Yeah, I'ma treat myself."
3.0,"What is the worst thing?[SEP]Amy Schumer, no debate."
4.0,What historical event would you like to see IRL?[SEP]* JFK Assassination * Tunguska Explosion * Volcanic Eruption of Pompeii * Sinking of Titanic * Events of Dyatlov Pass * Making of Easter Island Moais'
3.0,"What is a secret about you that even your parents or your significant other doesn’t know about you?[SEP]I once poured the milk in the bowl first before the cereal to see what it felt like to be an actually menace to society. It was a Rush, not gonna lie. Was this close to only eating the M&amp;Ms out the trail mix then down it with juice straight out of the carton and leave the empty bottle inside the fridge... but I stopped myself. Still have yet to let the folks know about my lil milk cereal thing though. Maybe one day. Maybe."
2.0,"What word would you remove from the dictionary and why?[SEP]I wont say the word, because I don't want more people to know of it. I hate that word. *It is an Internet slang term describing someone who performs excessive sympathy and attention toward another person, sometimes in pursuit of a sexual relationship.*"
4.0,"When has a seemingly casual chat with a coworker or boss turned into some crazy shit you weren’t expecting?[SEP]Coworker and I just having casual Monday morning BS conversation ""What were you up to this weekend"". Wasn't expecting him to get real and suddenly use me as an emotional crutch. Apparently he had been having a short affair with another colleague, wife found out, left that evening and had a one night stand with one of her colleagues. She returned that same night and said ""We're even now"". Then the next day she told their kids about daddy's affair and how he wants to leave the family... It was a shiiiitshow. Not knowing how to reply I just said, ""Dang man. That sucks... I played golf on Sunday"""
3.0,What does it mean when someone tells you you're the loneliest person they've ever met?[SEP]That they have never met someone who is more lonely then you I guess
4.0,What is one sense of humor you can't understand?[SEP]Making jokes regarding others disabilities?? Wtf?
3.0,"What do you know about Palestine?[SEP]They have a just cause, but totally wrong approach.."
3.0,What’s something that seems legit but actually isn’t?[SEP]Sending money to Nigerian princes
3.0,"Is it wrong to kiss your baby/toddler on the lips?[SEP]If it is then my kids are ruined. Cause I’m smooching them all the time, including on the lips. Although my oldest one doesn’t like it much anymore and I respect that so I don’t push it on them."
3.0,"What's something that you can't do because you didn't do it when you were little and didn't grow into it?[SEP]I lost my skateboarding abilities, but it was for a very specific reason. When I was young, I got good at skateboarding. But I ended up falling right onto my face. I broke both of my front teeth (and have veneers today). My dad got so scared of me skateboarding that he hid my skateboard! He put it on a high shelf in the garage, so I couldn’t get it even though I wanted to. I didn’t get that skateboard back until high school, and by then, I had lost all of my boarding abilities. I’m still mad about it."
4.0,"If you were to go vegan, what would be your go to foods?[SEP]Fake meat is getting decently convincing so my meals of choice probably wouldn't change much tbh. Failing that, I recently got a cast iron pan and have been roasting garlic buttered veggies. Potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, tomatoes. Amazing how good vegetables are when properly seasoned."
2.0,What company and why do you think is going to fix the semiconductor shortage that is affecting the automobile industry?[SEP]The same company that makes them now by just expanding production. If your company is big enough to cause a shortage it can be big enough to fix it.
3.0,"What are your favorite ways to lift the mood?[SEP]Don't know about you, but leaving the room always works for me"
5.0,"ELI5: Why does the screen size often need to be adjusted when a device is used with different displays?[SEP]On most TVs there's a setting for ""Overscan"" or ""Underscan"" that's a holdover from when people used CRT displays that weren't based on displaying a specific resolution. Movies and TV shows would get produced so that the image was a little bigger than what the viewer needed to see, with the idea that there was a border around the edge that was considered OK for TVs to crop out if they needed to. Digital displays (particularly if they include at least some analog inputs) kept the setting around because some people prefer to see things cropped the way they would have been on an older TV. This has a little more detailed explanation: [https://www.howtogeek.com/252193/hdtv-overscan-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-probably-turn-it-off/](https://www.howtogeek.com/252193/hdtv-overscan-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-probably-turn-it-off/)"
4.0,"ELI5: The Monty Hall Problem... there are two decision points: (a) which door, and (b) switch or stay... why is the probability of the second decision determined by the probability of the first one? Why are they not standalone probabilities?[SEP]It's because the Host is giving you information between your first pick and your second pick. In a system with 1,000,000 doors; he's telling you ""these 999,998 doors do not have a car behind them"". Prior to the reveal, you have a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of picking the correct door. After the reveal, you have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct door (in a closed system), but because the original set had so many doors, you can be reasonably sure that you didn't randomly pick the only correct door, so the chance that the other door has the car is 999,999 in 1,000,000. If the car could be moved, it would become a 50/50 after the reveal, just like you said. Well, not quite 50/50, but you'd have to know the tendency of the host to move the car in previous games. If he switches 50% of the time, then it's a 50/50. If he switches 33% of the time, it's 2 in 3, etc, etc. Again, we're just using the information the host is giving us."
4.0,"How do you choose between different word orders that are all grammatically correct?[SEP]It depends on a few things. Rhythm, especially in the context of the sentences before and after it. Also varied sentence structure, so you can use that flexibility to make sure it isn’t too similar to the lines before and after, and also emphasis, like an earlier commenter said. Also ease of reading/clarity. Sometimes you get a really unwieldy sentence. For example, if you had a list of items instead of just oil, starting the sentence with that would probably be better than smushing it into the middle. Or if you had another sentence fragment before or after that one connected with a conjunction, you might want to consider how close similar words are, or how awkward the structure is. That might not be everything, but hopefully it helps."
4.0,"ELI5: When we ‘lose’ our voice, like during a cold, what actually happens to our vocal cords?[SEP]Generally when you lose your voice the reason is your vocal chords are inflammed. Inflammation = swelling. When the vocal chords are swollen they become a different shape &amp; that alters the sound that they make (or don't make if it's bad enough) when you try to talk because the way they move the air is different."
3.0,"People who went to their High School Reunions, where are the Bullies/Nerds/Jocks/Wierd Kids now?[SEP]Everyone got fatter. Mostly everyone has the same personality, although the personalities that thrive in high school don’t always lend well to the “real world” so the tables had turned in many ways."
5.0,"ELI5: How does the sound barrier work? Why is there a transonic region that creates more drag than regions above and below?[SEP]The molecules in air (or any gas) are constantly whizzing around at high speed. They're actually going, basically, at the speed of sound all the time. But they're going in random directions and constantly bouncing off one another over relatively short distances. You feel this motion as pressure. If you try to move through air, the air molecules need to get out of the way. Since they're already going really fast that's pretty easy if you're going slowly. But as the speed you're going gets close to the speed \*they're\* going, it gets really hard for them to get out of the way fast enough. If you're going at the same speed as they are, they can't get out of the way and they pile up. That's a shockwave. Once you're going supersonic, a shockwave is the only way the air can change direction because it can't ""see"" the object coming...pressure in a fluid is transmitted at the speed of sound, if you're going faster than that the ""news"" that you're coming can't propogate upstream and the first time the air knows you've arrived is when the shockwave smacks into the air. Shockwaves involve a lot of energy dissipation (the air gets hotter), which is a source of drag. The faster you go, in general, the more drag because 1) you're pushing more air out of the way faster and 2) the shocks get stronger. Around transonic it gets really screwy because as you approach the speed of sound the flow on some parts of the vehicle will go supersonic before others. You end up with small shocks all over the place, which can interact with each other and the vehicle and generally totally screw up your streamlining because they flow directions get all out of whack. Streamlining for low speed is relatively easy. Streamlining for supersonic is repetitively easy. Streamlining for transsonic is a @!#%!@ mess, and super specific to the exact speed you're going. At anything other than the design speed, you're kind of screwed, so you generally get a big drag rise starting around M0.8 (ish) that goes away past about M1.2(ish). This is why most commercial jets live around M0.8-M0.9, and any particular one has an efficient range only 0.03 wide or so (the faster ones are using special tricks to delay some of the transsonic effects), and supercruising aircraft like F-22 run at M1.2+."
4.0,"What was it like your first time sneaking out?[SEP]Not me, but my younger brother (16 at the time). He came home from a mate's house slightly tipsy and declared to me (but not our parents) that he was gonna climb through the kitchen window after everyone else was asleep, go back to his mate's, then come back at 5am just before dad gets up to start getting ready to work. I stupidly didn't immediately tell our parents when he told me, mainly because he tends to hold grudges, and I agreed to keep quiet if he kept me out of it if he got caught, I even assisted him in sneaking out by flushing the toilet to cover up the noise of him climbing out the window. The best part is that he made the incredibly ballsy move of not coming back that night, instead opting to stay at his mate's ALL NIGHT. Luckily for him dad didn't check our room when he got up to go to work, and when our mom got up later she just assumed he went out skateboarding early that day. To this day, neither of them know about it."
4.0,"ELI5: why do you need less megapixels for film making, but more for photography?[SEP]Long story short, because the eye isn't good at distinguishing details of things in motion. When you're looking at something you need time for your eyes and brain to notice details and with noticing details will come noticing deficiencies in the image. On a photograph that amount of time is effectively infinite so we need a higher resolution. On a 24fps movie (the lowest frame rate we practically use) your eyes only ever get a maximum of 41.66ms to view any particular frame, not enough to really spot any quality deficiencies."
5.0,"To those who don’t procrastinate, what’s it like? What goes through your mind?[SEP]My breakthrough came with a simple thought - Excuses, by definition, will never be more than excuses. Excuses will never get you closer to your goal(s). If you continue to make excuses, you'll still be in the same place a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now. At some point you have to decide to act. You start small. Give yourself simple goals that are easy to achieve. Commit to 10 minutes of an activity. Try walking up the block for a week before trying to run a mile a day. Write a paragraph a day instead of buckling under the pressure of writing a full novel. Try giving up soda before changing your entire diet. Give yourself time. I know that sounds funny when talking about procrastination, but you do need to be patient with yourself and your expectations. Over time, what matters most is consistency. You need to build up to the habit you want. Don't try and go from 0 to 100 overnight. Instead, try getting 1% better every day."
4.0,"You discover your co-worker’s hidden napping spot at work and want to unleash an epic prank, what do you do?[SEP]how about making it the most awesome hiding napping spot? like, use the motion Sensors to play a lullaby Song for the first person entering after certain I'd time, and then turn it into an intruder alert warning system. place a coffee maker there that comes on 30min after someone enters... install a secret candydispenser, cozy lights, you Name it. show your coworker you care - pranking is fun once, this makes him your Fan forever"
4.0,"Am I in the wrong?[SEP]you’re not in the wrong. it’s really weird that she doesn’t want to invite her boyfriend to the game anymore because her ex is there. i personally have learned to never trust a girl that will favor their ex over their current relationship in any situation. they might like her ex more but they’re broken up now and you’re her current. if you don’t want to play, let her know that. don’t force yourself into a bad time if you feel like it’ll end bad. she’d be upset too if you did the same thing so she has no excuses rn."
4.0,"What Was the Most Awkward Moments of Your Life?[SEP]Having 600 people applaud my (presumed) loss of virginity. High school graduation, my date was graduating with me. We stupidly assumed that we didn't need to be in the line waiting to enter the auditorium with all other classmates 45 mins early, so we hung out at his house. Meanwhile in the alphabetical line of graduates standing outside the auditorium doors, two of my friends notice my absence and start talking to each other. My friend with last name ""A"" is talking to my other friend with last name ""G"", so several people in the line heard that I was missing. People who noticed I was missing included my date's friends ""K"" and ""J"", who were asking down the line about where my date was. And, before you know it, the entire class of 70 was noticing our absence. Now, since we arrived late and there was nowhere to park, we used a side door that was quite far away from our class. So we had a long walk of shame indoors when we finally arrived. Our entire class started applauding, wolf-whistling and cheering what they assumed we had done. All the noise traveled into the auditorium and the back of the room assumed the noise was due to the fact that the grads were entering the room, so they stood up and started cheering and clapping. The middle of the room thought that the people at the back were applauding because the grads were coming in, so they followed suit. And then so did the front of the auditorium. This means that, at one point, approximately 600 people were applauding the sex that I most definitely did not have. And I could hear the whole lot of them applauding long after I got in to my proper place in line. My dress was dark green and, combined with my face, I must have looked like Christmas in June. A year later at my brother's grad, people were commenting on the early applause from the year before, still confused that ""We all started clapping when the grads came in last year, but then it was another 10 minutes before the grads came in! What was that about?"" It has been 24 years. I am still embarrassed."
3.0,"What's your favorite type of dancing? Disco, Square, etc..?[SEP]Disco. Lord forbid they put me on the dancefloors, I know how to bust a move on them bois."
3.0,What are you a hypocrite of?[SEP]Giving advice to my depressed dad.
4.0,What is a good TV show to watch when trying to fall asleep?[SEP]I would personally go with a podcast (uses less electricity!). Though...I'm reminded that you can actually set your Home theater system on a timer (the one that goes to either the main power-point or your laptop --- if your just using that to watch)... If you're struggling to fall asleep...than I wouldn't recommend trying to watch something. But if you already feel like you're about to snooze...but need that extra 'bedtime nudge' with your laptop on...playing something... Then I'd go with a show you like. It actually doesn't matter if it's a thriller or not...because....if you're sleepy...and don't fight it...then you should be okay. But if not. I'd go for setting up a timer every 20 minutes and looking at the box sets you have available in your collection. If you've watched 'Friday Night Lights' before...try it until your time beeps. Then change until you find a show that you find yourself drifting off to...
4.0,"What is something you have done that you are proud of?[SEP]Unfortunately I’m not good at much, but I passed my drivers test at age 21 (7 years ago). I had previously cancelled the test two times since I felt “no point - I’m gonna fail” and then failed the first time I took it and according to the driving school that lended me the car, I failed the test with the second worst score (100 points) the driving instructor had ever seen, and he had worked there for 30+ years. But I passed it after that!"
3.0,"What did the Army teach you about cleaning?[SEP]Former marine here. Worked at a company and a bunch of investors were coming through for a tour. Bizdev guys decided the whole shop had to be thoroughly cleaned, but they only thought of it the day before the walkthrough, because they were idiots. The engineers and chemists, all of whom had equity in this (failing) startup all thought that staying late and cleaning the place was beneath them. I, also an engineer but an experienced field day participant, had no qualms about getting my hands dirty, nor do I see cleaning up as ""beneath"" me or in any way degrading. So I stayed all night, rented a floor waxer, and made that place sparkle. We didn't get the investment, so idk if it was worth doing, but what definitely WAS worth doing was talking to two of the younger engineers the next day when they were like ""that's not our job to wax the floor"" and I had the opportunity to tell them ""you don't have the required skills to do it, it wouldn't have made a difference if you two stayed all night to clean, it still would have looked like shit"""
3.0,"To people who seem to know every damn actor on the planet by name, how did you gain this knowledge?[SEP]This always cracks me up. A friend of mine is this way and she's like ""so and so and so and so are both in this movie."" Come again ? You gotta just tell me another character they play for me to know who that is and still yet, I probably won't."
3.0,"What's with all the ""what's your pronouns?"" thing?[SEP]To make them feel more respected I think? I also don't get why some people prefer to be called a specific pronoun while don't care if I'm called a she or he."
3.0,What about frozen cap?[SEP]He finally was able to retire. He knew how everything would turn out (at least through endgame when he would be too old to do anything anyways as time travel cap). No one should be expected to fight forever and everyone needs their rest and he finally decided to allow himself that rest.
4.0,What is the worst mistake you have ever made in your job?[SEP]Crashing a set of servers. ... remote serves ... ... that no one could get to....
5.0,"How do we know the truth or falsity of synthetic a priori propositions according to Kant?[SEP]By synthetic a priori, Kant is usually talking about mathematics (arithmetic and geometry). Kant thinks we can know them because we have a priori categories of understanding and spatio-temporal form of intuition (and pure intuition) to structure and condition our experience. We can know them because, in a rough sense, they ""come from us"". For Kant, a successful mathematical reasoner can know the truths of arithmetic and geometry by constructing the associated concepts through intuitions. This is how Burge describes it: &gt; I shall, however, sketch my view of it. Kant takes pure intuition in geometry to be intuitions of determinate objects. The objects of intuition are particulars, such as line-drawings, or even possible line-drawings, in pure geometrical intuition—pure imagination. (They can also be intuited in em- pirical intuition, on paper; but only non-empirical formal aspects of the empirical intuition play any role in mathematical understanding, reasoning, and justification.) From these objects one abstracts objects of a more general kind—‘the triangle’, for example—which are the objects of mathematical reasoning. 45 These latter objects are forms within the structure of space or time—on Kant’s idealist view, forms of spatio-temporal intuition itself. https://philosophy.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Burge-2000-Frege-on-Apriority.pdf &gt; synthetic propositions typically true based on their conformity to the world For Kant, analytic truths are truths about identity statements which are only good for clarification (they say nothing new but clarify what's already known within the concepts under use). The analytic propositions (Kant's version), also, usually involve some ""concept-containment"" (for example the predicate may be contained in the subject). Synthetic propositions are basically negation of all that. It says some new things instead of just expanding what's contained in a concept. So for example, that ""12"" is a result of adding ""5"" and ""7"", is synthetic because 12 is neither contained in the concept of 5, 7, or addition (+). 12 is a product of synthesizing them. So it's not necessarily just about ""conformity"" to the world (in some sense even analytic statements can be said to ""conform""). Note: analytic-synthetic division is contentious and a very messy topic. Different aspects of Kantian style of analyticity vs synthetic have been under attack by a lot of later philosophers for the right or wrong reasons. Disclaimer: I am not an expert (or anything close). However, I had a course recently on a related topic."
5.0,ELI5: What does Neanderthal gene sequencing actually tell us about human-Neanderthal interactions? And is there any other evidence of interaction?[SEP]The first archeological sites where we found Neanderthals they were buried under newer evidence of Homo Sapiens. So the theory was that over time Neanderthals were displaced for Sapiens. However the more sites we found and the more we were able to explore of these sites the more complex things became. We did not just find Neanderthal remains under Sapiens remains but sometimes it was the other way around and sometimes they were buried right next to each other. And this suggests that they were not simply competing with each other and over shared resources but they appeared to be living together in the same caves at the same time. And that is quite uncommon for different species to do. And when we were able to sequence Neanderthal genes we discovered that some of the unique mutations in Neanderthals which were not present in Sapiens at that time are now present in modern day humans. That means that modern humans have some Neanderthal ancestors. And that explains the previous archeological finds where we see Neanderthals and Sapiens living together because they were actually together and able to reproduce with each other.
4.0,"What video game character/monster scared you the most as a child?[SEP]The Carnotaurus at the beginning of the movie ""Dinosaur"". I watched that movie so many time but I always got scared at that one scene."
5.0,"Is Malcolm Gladwell reputable from a social science perspective? Are his books and such well-based in strong research?[SEP]He writes good stuff, but it is important to keep in mind that he is not a social scientist, and that what he publishes is pop science. [He can be a (very) controversial figure among academics, and he has had his fair share of strong disagreements.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell#Reception) Broadly speaking, I have enjoyed his books and there are for example articles he has written for the *New Yorker* I believe are insightful, however I would invite approaching his production with due diligence: i.e. *reader beware* and do not use him as a primary source for scientific knowledge. I mostly share [Andrew Gelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gelman)'s opinion, who has written multiple times on his blog about Gladwell and his controversies or debates with other academics. [Quote](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/12/valley-of-gladwell/): &gt;**Gladwell is a fun writer, and I like how he plays with ideas.** To my taste, though, **he lives in an uncanny valley between nonfiction and fiction, or maybe I should say between science and storytelling.** I’d enjoy him more, and feel better about his influence, if he’d take the David Sedaris route and go all the way toward storytelling (with the clear understanding that he’s telling us things because they sound good or they make a good story, not because they’re true), or conversely become a real science writer and evaluate science and data claims critically. Instead **he’s kind of in between, bouncing back and forth between stories and science, and that makes uncomfortable.** In short, he has reported on or publicized good research and promoted engagement among laypeople with the social sciences, **however** it is also true that there are problems with the scientific accuracy of his books, and the quality of his fact checking. [See here for some extended discussion on the topic, again by Gelman.](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/10/11/gladwell-vs-chabris-david-vs-goliath/) I would recommend taking his books for what they are (emphasis on *entertainment* rather than education), and as a gateway into the world of the social sciences, keeping in mind that his work is not academic, and that [his primary goal is to be a populariser](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/01/malcolm-gladwell-interview-talking-to-strangers-apolitical), i.e.: “to get people to take human psychology seriously and to respect the complexity of human behaviour and motivations”."
5.0,"What is the stupidest thing someone has said whilst trying to be “cool”?[SEP]I was on a school trip, and we had to spend a week in dorms. Well, this one kid must have had a ""happy"" dream one night, because he had a boner in his sleep. We all knew this, because this one guy who had been bullying him for pretty much their entire lives went round and told us. The next day, the guy who got the boner was talking to some of the girls, and the bully kid shouted across to him ""Try to not get a hard on, I saw it last night... it was massive!"" The bully, in an effort to embarrass this kid, clearly didn't realise that he's just told a bunch of hormonal teenage girls, that the guy they're talking to has a massive dick, and also didn't realise that all of this is making him look like he spent the night staring at this kid's massive dick."
4.0,"Who was the drunkest person you have ever seen in public, and what was the outcome?[SEP]Probably myself. At conventions I've had 2 occasions where I've blacked out A. in a hotel lobby B. In some bushes outside of the venue Both cases, the ambulances were called and I woke up while they were trying to load me in the truck, could barely walk, told them on both occasions ""I have the right to show medical treatment. Show me where to sign, because I'm not going anywhere with you"" and on both occasions found another party at the convention to go drink more"
5.0,"ELI5: How do they create and trap the scents into wax for candles?[SEP]“Scents” are physical things, molecules that interact with sensory nerves in your nose, that your brain then interprets as different smells. So, the first step is getting a concentration of that molecule, usually in liquid form, they’re either made synthetically in a lab, or refined from nature (like essential oils). Then that liquid is just mixed in with melted wax, then when the wax is burnt by the candle it releases those molecules into the air again for you to smell."
5.0,"ELI5: What does a ""RICO"" mean?[SEP]It's a legal term than means if you can prove a group was engaged in organized crime, you can charge all group members with the same crime even if there was only one who physically did the deed"
4.0,"What is something someone said to you that wasn’t intended to affect you as much as it did?[SEP]Yesterday I had an end of the year talk with my English professor to discuss what grade we thought I deserve. I told him I think a 90%, and he said that was modest, and he was thinking a 95%. I’ve never been confident in my writing but I *loved* his class, so it meant a lot to me. I think it’s something that will stick with me forever, still want to cry happy tears when I think about it."
5.0,"people who have survived a natural disaster, what was it like?[SEP]I'm from FL and have lived through if I had to guess, 10 major hurricanes. Most of them spawned tornadoes or the winds of the hurricane itself were strong enough to destroy buildings on their own. The handful that came through in like 2007 (Charley, Jean or Francis maybe?) were so bad that one of them tore off the flat section of our roof that sat over my brother and I's bedrooms/the hallway and our bathroom. It didn't come all the way off tho, it fell back down like 6 inches from its original location so there was a 6 inch gap in the ceiling between the main A frame roof and the flat one over that end of the house. As in, you could look up and see the sky and our bedrooms flooded because of the rain. We lost most of our possessions to water or mold damage"
4.0,What are some helpful household tips that will really save you money down the road?[SEP]Lights off unless you need them on
3.0,If you wake up tomorrow and you're the only person on Earth what would you still bother doing and why?[SEP]Ide shit in the town square
4.0,"ELI5: Why do actors look bigger on screen -- the camera adds 10 pounds?[SEP]There's a lot of ways to manipulate aspects of filming something to make it appear one way or another. Lenses can be used to make someone appear fatter, skinnier, older, more attractive, etc. Hell, Tom Cruise is 5' 7"" but the way they film him hides that fact. The 10 pounds part usually comes from someone appearing on broadcast TV with a regular host they know how to film well from them being on constantly. Likewise with makeup and wardrobe. Meanwhile their guest is just a one off and the crew can't make everyone look good on a whim"
4.0,"What's the most valuable thing you can buy with $50,- ?[SEP]You can always make a donation to a charitable cause or medical research project. $50 can help make a difference and help better the world we live in which honestly, can be pretty valuable."
5.0,"What's my prospect after a masters in Neuroscience?[SEP]Based on what has been going on in the department I am in in big pharma, I would say a masters puts you in a strange position. You are overqualified for associate scientist roles (lab tech) but not qualified enough for senior scientist roles (at least right out of your degree; add several years of experience and this is fine). If the hiring manager thinks you are the perfect fit, they will adjust the title of the position to fit your qualifications, but I haven't seen this happen much. You can slowly work your way up. However, I think this will be less likely than it used to be just because there are so many PhDs now. My potential new manager is one such person who slowly worked their way up to research fellow. It is still not easy getting into industry with a PhD. I would recommend applying to some place like Biogen (still does a lot of neuroscience work) and see where you get. Some of the bigger companies offer programs that allow you to get your PhD while working too. I'm not sure if Biogen does or not."
3.0,"What are some mind blowing examples of the butterfly effect?[SEP]What blows my mind is we only notice the big ones with important goings on attached to them, and for every one of those noticed, there's a near infinite number of the tiniest occurrences causes ripples through everything every second, bouncing off other ripples and merging with others so that not one single insignificant thing has ever happened, nor ever will. It's awe inspiring"
4.0,"How did you and your current/last partner meet?[SEP]I met my husband (married 14 yrs now) at work. I flirted with him by throwing a garbage can at him. He liked it. The last super serious relationship before him, I met online. As in AOL. When it was new. Lol."
5.0,"What is your favourite ""they don't make like this anymore"" thing?[SEP]Architectural things that aren't deemed useful or practical any more. I love a house with hidden hallways where staff used to get around, immense gothic cathedrals with hundreds of years of effort to build, rough hewn slate roof shingles, stone fences built by hand. These are so wonderful to admire and explore, but not an efficient use of money for new construction. I'm from the US and I was stunned to go in the immense cathedrals in Barcelona and Paris. I can't wait to visit ancient mosques in the future!"
5.0,"What do you think is the most sentimental thing you destroyed of a previous owner’s house?[SEP]Tried to put a garden in a place that was their old pet cemetery, apparently. I would've thought you'd bury them under a tree, or something. Nope! smack in the middle of a 1 acre backyard, according to the previous residents"
4.0,What is something you hate having to buy at the grocery store?[SEP]Bottled water. Biggest waste of money if you're in a first world country without a natural disaster. Heavy. It's just less-processed municipal water unless you live in a town called Flint.
5.0,"If you’re blind and you have a seeing eye dog, how do you pick up it’s poop?[SEP]Seeing-eye dogs are trained to go at specific times in specific places so the owners know where to pick it up. I learned from documentary called Pick of the Litter"
4.0,"What’s your favorite show/movie that takes place in your city/state?[SEP]*Revenge of the Nerds* It was filmed at my college (U. of Arizona) -- all the locations were extremely familiar. Also, *Logan's Run* was filmed in Dallas where I lived for a while. I knew a lot of the ""futuristic"" locations. A shopping center where I spent lots of my youth, a skating rink near the airport, an office building where I've had two different jobs, the bar part of a restaurant I've been to, and maybe a couple of other locations."
4.0,"For the people who like astronomy what do you think lies on the other side of the observable universe?[SEP]That's a really good question. It's really hard to tell. Could be a void and a whole another universe in a distance. Then you zoom out and see a whole bunch of other universes in little balls, kinda like how galaxies are. And it could just keep going and going as we zoom out. Possibilities are endless, kinda like our ever-expanding universe (before the shrinking phase)."
2.0,"Why is 'sex talk' so quasi-cannibalistic?[SEP]If you have thought about it enough to make this post, and still don't understand it, you'll probably never understand it."
4.0,"Which movie title from movies you know has absolutely nothing to do with the movie content itself?[SEP]okay it's not the original title of the movie, but just a really bad translation: you know cloudy with a chance of meatballs? accurate description, put into a good pattern. It's a good, amusing title. in hebrew? Falafel Rain. there's no falafels in the movie, and the only saving grace is that it wasnt geshem shel basar - which can mean meat rain but also rain of flesh. the second one is Alien, called in hebrew ""the eighth passenger."" like. wuht"
2.0,What are some dark secrets about the pawn industry?[SEP]A lot of it is stolen
3.0,"How would you rate yourself overall(personality, intelligence, looks, etc.) and why?[SEP]4 ish, on my best day I'd say 4 max Idk, tbh I don't think I'm too much of a desirable person, my personality is very dull and ig bland to many people, like im really awkward and can't pick up on social cues well and just a lot of things, but thats who I am, and then looks, yeah, nah, those aren't there."
4.0,What small thing ticks you off?[SEP]Youtube recommendations. How do they manage to recommend me this much trash I wouldn't watch in a million years and why do the feedback options seemingly do absolutely nothing?
5.0,"If you were a mad scientist, with no morals and no illegal restrictions, what experiment would you do first?[SEP]“Extinction Event” level weapon"
5.0,"What is one relationship advice that has worked wonders for you?[SEP]One word, COMMUNICATION. Just because two people are basically reading each others minds, doesn't mean you can. My parents broke up when I was 6-7 years old, I remember not being upset in the slightest bc it was just constant arguing. Was happy, I remember years later asking my grandma what went wrong with their relationship. She told me one word, ""COMMUNICATION"" (lol she didn't yell it). It's always stuck with me... Unless your into playing games and not actually being close to the one you love, just talk. Not over a phone or anything like that (insert *ok boomer* reply under lol), but I've been in absolute love with my middle school/high school sweetheart since she first knocked over my binder during class and we locked eyes. We've had our ups and downs, but we always come back stronger and more in love with one another for one reason... COMMUNICATION."
4.0,"How should I deal with neighborhood bully?[SEP]I'm not very old or wise so take what I say with a grain of salt perhaps but I always find when I get down, whether it be by my own hand or by someone else I enjoy doing something that makes me feel proud, I do that through creating something. Hobbies like writing or drawing or sewing or woodworking or cooking, even if it's something small you can take pride in it, and I find when I step back and appreciate my creation the negative thoughts outside of the beauty and simplicity of having something you've made yourself."
4.0,"What was the coolest McDonald’s toy you’ve ever gotten as a kid?[SEP]Idk if this is lame in comparison to what most people had available in the US, Australia had some cool stuff but nothing like what I’ve heard. Right when the first Incredibles movie came out, I got the Frozone “Maccas” toy and I thought that thing was from the future. It was frozen on top of a giant ice ball that you could roll, but due to weights inside and multiple layers of plastic he would remain at the top of the ball when it rolled I was obsessed for a good while with that and how it worked"
4.0,"How do you politely tell your upstairs neighbor that their kid makes too much noise?[SEP]Your upstairs neighbor already knows that, but what are they supposed to do? Kids make noise. If you live in apartment buildings with kids, you're going to have to deal with noisy kids. That's all there is to it, and it's one of the reasons why living in an apartment building sometimes sucks."
5.0,"What time did the word ""cap"" become a synonym for ""lie""?[SEP]It's been a thing in AAVE since the mid-20th century. In the 40s, ""to cap"" was used to mean to excel or surpass (referring to 'cap' in the context of the top or upper limit, rather than the hat). In the 60s, it came to mean to brag about excelling at something, and the phrase ""no cap"" developed to mean ""I'm not bragging"" and eventually ""I'm not bragging falsely (aka lying)"". It did kind of fall out of use for a while, but it cropped up on social media (at least commonly) in around 2012 and boomed in popularity in 2017 when Young Thug &amp; Future released their song *No Cap*."
5.0,"What gameshow prize would you actually HATE to win?[SEP]I would hate to win a boat. I live 90 minutes from a lake that allows boats, and the ocean is at least 4 hours away. The upkeep cost for boats would be way too expensive for me to handle."
3.0,How long would your commute be if you had to rent an affordable one bedroom apartment on minimum wage?[SEP]If you're only getting minimum wage it doesn't seem like a good idea to try to rent an entire apartment by yourself. Get a roommate or rent a room somewhere.
3.0,What to Watch after Rick And Morty?[SEP]btw R&amp;M is my first adult cartoon
3.0,What are some song that has tragic story behind it?[SEP]Eric clapton with tears in heaven
4.0,"What was the most ridiculous reason your date gave you for not wanting a second date?[SEP]It was weird, we had three dates and I thought they went fantastic, and all the feedback she was giving me seemed like she thought the same. Then suddenly she basically started ignoring me, said she was busy, then she had family issues, then she was sick, then all three. After a while I figured she was giving me a hint. To this day I never got any closure on the situation."
4.0,"People with foot fetishes: What is it that turns you on and why?[SEP]Varies from fetishist to fetishist. Commonalities lie among sole shape, arch height, toe length, size, even the nationality of the model. Positions like toe curls and toe spreads greatly show off things like sole wrinkling. Some people like to be dominated, others like to have physical intimacy with them, others like the look, or some just like all of the above. Personally, I prefer bigger sized feet on women (8.5-10) with a long toe shape. Gives more to work with, worship, lick, etc. They must be well taken care of as well. Love to be physical with them with a light side of domination."
4.0,"What songs have you listened to that sent shivers up your spine?[SEP]There's a lot of film and game music that does this for me. John Williams' [Binary Sunset](https://youtu.be/u2W5YPQJqUs) from A New Hope, Mark Knopfler's [Storybook Love](https://youtu.be/tgVAA7crk8g) from The Princess Bride, O'Donnell and Salvatori's [Rain](https://youtu.be/yWh9l8RSkPk) from Halo:ODST, and Gao's [Giselle](https://youtu.be/2PqKxRuSFyk) from The House in Fata Morgana, to name a few."
3.0,If you could buy any planet in the universe which one would you buy?[SEP]Earth. I take control of the space agencies and have them build my rocket to europa.
4.0,"How do researchers stay up to date on all the literature in the STEM field?[SEP]I honestly, don't think I've read more than 5 papers to completion..ever? I have a good pulse on the work that emerges in my immediate subdiscipline, but in reality, there's no reason to keep up to date with the *wholeee* STEM field! That would be counterproductive and wasteful IMO. Reading papers: Intros/abstracts/conclusions (digging deeper when necessary) Attending conferences, colloquiums, talks, collaborations"
2.0,What would you do right now if you knew that time would be reset to this exact moment in three hours?[SEP]Probably nothing because it's 3 in the morning
4.0,"Series that I will enjoy as much as Harry Potter?[SEP]I know they're suggested a lot, but the mythology books starting with *Percy Jacksoon and the Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan encompass a lot of what you mentioned you loved about HP. *Artemis Fowl* by Eoin Colfer is another series that you'll probably enjoy. Tamora Pierce has two worlds that are excellent, they begin with *Sandry's Book* and *Alanna: the First Adventure*. These are all wonderful, but I've been looking for that Harry Potter high for 21 years, and I'm pretty convinced at this point that there will never be another book that makes me feel at home as much as they do."
5.0,"How do you handle your finances with your spouse (and why)?[SEP]mostly seperately, as he is gradually improving his financial responsibility to me. he grew up used to his parenta being close to broke-not b.c they arent money smart, but they had 2 kids and a mortgage. so like many people, hes used to the poverty mindset of bank account yoyoing around zero, where you spend it anytime i have money. the problem with this is you dont save, ever. which would still be ok, if i made good money and could afford it. but i dont have the motivation or see the need for it. i make just enough to get by, and save a little bit-if im not paying for his stuff. i paid all the rent for years, and his unnecessary spending barely improved. as of 3 yrs ago, now we split rent, and he buys about 1/3 of groceries tho i do all the shopping. unsurprisingly, as soon as he had to pay rent he suddenly spent less money on dumb shit like ordering out all the time, clothes even tho the closet if full of them, pet baby tarantulas and fish, etc. old car loans are paid off, and student loans have less than 10%left to pay. he did get a new car, which i didnt really apprive of, but used cars arent a great deal right now, and he did research and pick one that keeps its value. just now, after 10 yrs together, he has like 2000$ in case of emergency. but its a turning point, as with loans finally paid off, hell be able to pay me back rent, or save a few thousand a yr at least. and maybe we can get married next yr, tho we will likely continue to keep our finances seperate."
4.0,"What joke cracks you up everytime?[SEP]Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson decide to go on a camping trip. After dinner and a bottle of wine, they lay down for the night, and go to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend. ""Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see."" Watson replied, ""I see millions of stars."" ""What does that tell you?"" Watson pondered for a minute. ""Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets."" ""Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo."" ""Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three."" ""Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant."" ""Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow."" ""What does it tell you, Holmes?"" Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke: ""Watson, you idiot. Someone has stolen our tent!"" Ive seen variations being profane and different names but its the punch line that gets me constantly"
4.0,What made you absolutely despise your siblings?[SEP]He's an absolute dumbass that don't care about his family and in particular our mother (cursed frequently). I also suspect him of being a sociopath
4.0,"What's so bad about non-tenure track positions?[SEP]Yes. It would be helpful to clarify the type of position. You are not referring to adjuncts, but rather teaching faculty hired through contracts. You can see some examples on the Penn State website: [https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ac21#E](https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ac21#E) "". Ranks for non-tenure-line teaching faculty 1. **Lecturer or Instructor -** A lecturer or instructor should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent, or be an active candidate for a terminal degree, in an academic field related to their teaching specialization. 2. **Assistant Teaching Professor -** The assistant teaching professor should possess a terminal degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his/her teaching specialization; alternatively, the assistant teaching professor without a terminal degree should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to their teaching specialization; must have demonstrated ability as a teacher and adviser; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and/or mastery of subject matter. 3. **Associate Teaching Professor -** The associate teaching professor should possess a terminal degree in an academic field related to their teaching specialization; must have demonstrated ability as a teacher and adviser; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and/or mastery of subject matter. Alternatively, the associate teaching professor without a terminal degree should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to their teaching specialization; must have demonstrated exceptional ability as a teacher and adviser while in the rank of senior lecturer or instructor; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and/or mastery of subject matter at a level of distinction beyond that of the assistant teaching professor. 4. **Teaching Professor -** The teaching professor should possess a terminal degree in an academic field related to their teaching specialization; must have demonstrated exceptional ability as a teacher and adviser while in the rank of associate teaching professor; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and/or mastery of subject matter at a level of distinction beyond that of the associate teaching professor.

5.0,For those of you who don’t like dogs...why? Are you ok?[SEP]Honestly most dogs are very smelly along with being pretty needy and have to be trained so they don’t destroy your home. I have owned a dog before and while I loved her dearly I would definitely have a cat over a dog any day. Dogs are fine when other people have them but I rather have a pet that is pretty easy to maintain because of my schedule. Dogs are good for people who have a lot of energy and time though
3.0,"What do coaches say in locker rooms when your team is losing badly?[SEP]I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed"
5.0,"[Star Wars] Why are B1 battle droids cowardly?[SEP]The Star Wars *Essential Guide to Warfare* sourcebook has an interesting segment where it explains why the Battle Droids have such comical incompetence. Essentially it was a combination of cheap/bad design and sabotage. The Trade Federation was notoriously cheap in making it’s droids, and it especially showed with the B1s. This was exacerbated by the fact that the design needed to be overhauled following the Battle of Naboo, which exposed the vulnerability of the loss of the command center causing a shutdown of the army. The B1 was redesigned to be able to operate autonomously, but between bad programming done on the cheap and hardware limitations they began to suffer from more frequent glitches. This was exacerbated by the Republic Intelligence service infecting many of the production lines with malware that while not serious enough to shut the droid down directly (and thereby tip off even the Separatists’ lax quality control) would cause the droids to have an increased tendency to quirkiness and bumbling."
5.0,"ELI5: How does Kanji have more than 1 pronunciation?[SEP]Not learning Japanese, but have read up on it. Kanji (漢字), as its name suggests, isn't native to the Japanese (日) language, it's merely a borrowed script from China. When the script is borrowed, you can use it in a few ways: 1. Use the meaning of the character, and import it's meaning to Japanese. (semantic borrowing) 2. Use the sound of the character, and import the sound to Japanese. (Phonological borrowing) This results in (1) being used to represent words existing in native Japanese, (eg. 時 used to represent 'toki'; time) and (2) being used for new ideas (eg. 時代 'jidai'; era). This is a general rule, but not always true. From the above, there can be derived the two types of Kanji readings: Kun'yomi (meaning-reading; (1)) and on'yomi (sound-reading (2)). There is a complication from on'yomi; multiple times in history, the Japanese have travelled to China to obtain new knowledge, or for trade, and these form the backbone of multiple on'yomi readings: 1. Go-on (from the 5th Century Jin China) 2. Kan-on (from the 7th Century Tang China) 3. Tō-on (from the 10th Century Song China to 15th Century Ming China) During these periods, language in China has always been changing, and thus the sound borrowed also changes, despite the character remaining the same. Thus, there exists many different readings of a single Kanji character."

4.0,What do you as a breakfast if you are a overtime student?[SEP]eggs they're easy to make and can still be healthy and tasty
5.0,"What's the science behind post nutting?[SEP]Your reward system. You're goal is to nut and when you do so you become more capable of thinking clearly. You can also accomplish this through other things. If you have a job interview, fight, or anything that will make you feel strong emotions. You will feel relaxed and more capable of deep thought. You are simply capable of putting your energy into thought rather than action because you mind believes it has already settled the physical matters"
4.0,When was last time you cried and why?[SEP]A few years ago. Argument with my narcissist mother than ended in angry tears
4.0,"How should we interpret human ability to imagine impossibilities and get stuck in unprovable claims?[SEP]&gt; Human beings are so paranoid. Descarte's demon making fun of us while controlling laws of nature, solpsism, brains in the vat,just to name a few. We tend to have ability to get stuck in logic by coming up with unprovable and undisprovable theories. Why do we do that? In philosophy this is done to push the boundaries of epistemology and often helps to come up with better epistemic insights in trying to respond to them. I don't think many philosophers do get ""stuck"" with them. &gt; Even science seems to comply to this quality of human mind. Probability of even extremly rare events is almost never 0. And when someone puts a probability to 0, another person will come up with ""what if"" We can always imagine a sneaky way how something impossible can actually happen. We add zeroes after the coma but we feel urge to put this one on the end. Just in case. Why are humans capable of coming up with such a absurd things? I find it weird and unnerving. Like everything's possible. And I don't mean it in a good way. I don't see anything absurd going on here. There are usually some unaccounted variables which can result in a degree of randomness (or pseudo-randomness) which leaves an ever-so-slight chance open that the experimental findings are erroneous. This isn't explicitly related to paranoia about being a brain in a vat or being under the influence of Descartes' Demon. &gt; Every clean cut answer about nature of reality crashes on it. Theism, atheism. Theism even more , since the mere possibility of bolzmann brains just don't very well fit into neat concept of world ruled by omnibenevolent, omnipotent, omniscient being. Why would god make us come up with those terrifying statistical aberrations? This seems like a variation of the problem of evil. Theists can just answer ""it is a necessary evil"" for a greater good. To have sufficient intelligence (which is a good) in a finite context is to necessarily have the capacity to imagine wierd possibilities. Moreover, normally people are not that bothered by remote possibilities. So most people wouldn't even call it as an important kind of ""evil"". Your terror seems idiosyncratic (although you aren't necessarily alone). There can be a more secular answer based on evolution but I won't go there. But more generally it would seem that ability to imagine wierd possibilities would be a byproduct of ability of imagining possibilities and counterfactuals in general (see [this](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modality-epistemology/) for an article concerning epistemology of modality) &gt; And eastern religions and philosopies? The same problem. Why would in a world made of pure love and oneness exist those types of concepts? You may be significantly misunderstanding some of those Eastern religions. &gt; If you know some literature on that topic don't hesitate to recommend it May be these will help: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modality-epistemology/ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/ https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/1sk.htm https://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/files/wittgenstein-on-certainty.pdf"

4.0,"ELI5: Can insects, crabs, spiders, and other animals with an exoskeleton become overweight or obese?[SEP]Hey I posted about this on r/askscience a while ago. I have a PhD in insect physiology specializing in insect metabolism. Insects can develop obesity like symptoms and what looks like type 2 diabetes. The extra fat doesn't make them bigger in their exoskeleton, but does get packed in there. Here's a paper on dragonflies that get obese! &amp;#x200B; [https://www.pnas.org/content/103/49/18805.short](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/49/18805.short)"
5.0,"Eli5 Why does our breathing affects our heartbeats speed when we do nothing?[SEP]The heart is responsible for making sure the body has enough oxygen to function (among other things). It needs to get that oxygen from the lungs. So if you breathe poorly and don't take in a lot of oxygen, the heart will try to compensate. Every time you breathe out, you're not exhaling pure carbon dioxide, there's still some oxygen in there since it's hard to use up all the oxygen in one breath. But in a case like where the person is holding their breath, the heart starts running as much blood by the lungs as possible to try and scrape up as much of the remaining oxygen as it can."
5.0,"Have you ever ate at Denny's while not drunk? What happened?[SEP]My grandpa, when he become older would eat at Denny’s every single day sometime even multiple times. Everyone know him and whenever we came to visit we would eat Denny’s every single day until we left...... it’s wasn’t bad and now I have good memory’s about Denny’s. One day they bulldoze the building and after that my grandpa couldn’t find another solid place to eat at."
4.0,"What are your opinions about Critical Race Theory?[SEP]We should always be critical thinkers, and in particular we should be critical of historical and current power structures that have created and sustain widespread social inequalities and injustices."

The whole movie? Surely not. Surely... it's er... hmm... still looping... 15 minutes in... getting a lil repetitive. Not the *whole* movie. *Surely.* Other ponderous questions such as, did they... intend for the cat to just walk off mid sentence? Are these actually voice actors or the directors kids? Was the lack of sound effect intentional? Is this set in a alternate sound dampened universe with no noise except poor child actors and a 20 second music loop?!?!?!"

He won’t be fooled by me putting the oven on to warm plates up. Then the kids come down to await the food delivery. The dog now barks a bit because he knows the doorbell is going to ring. Barking intensifies until the food is delivered and he gets thrown a bit of pizza or curry."

5.0,"What was growing up in the 90's like?[SEP]I graduated high school in 1998 and I have to say the best thing about growing up then was that there is no video evidence of all the absolutely stupid shit I did. Cell phones existed when I was in high school but they were super expensive so most of us had pagers. Mine was see-through and a full-text capable one. We would try to see what was the strangest messages we could get the pager operators to type out. We played airport tag and ran through the airside without an issue. We were able to wait for arriving flights and play the dangerous game of saying ""Hi, Jack!"" to the group of arriving passengers. If we annoyed a security guard, we were just asked to leave and weren't arrested. To get rides home from our parents when we were out somewhere with our friends, we used collect calls to record ""momcomepickmeup"" in the part where you should say your name. Our parents would deny the charges and head out to pick us up. The 90s were a wild time for me"
4.0,"I’m trying to better understand the existence of numbers. Do any numbers other than positive whole numbers exist in the natural world?[SEP]According to [mathematical platonism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/), the most popular position among mathematicians and philosophers today, all numbers exist, but are abstract (i.e., nowhere spatially located and lack causal powers). According to [mathematical nominalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-mathematics/), numbers either do not exist, or are concrete rather than abstract. The former variety of nominalism is [mathematical fictionalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism-mathematics/), according to which numbers do not exist but should be regarded as merely convenient fictions."

3.0,"People that work in liquor stores, how do you resist the temptation to drink on the job?[SEP]As someone who worked in a bar, you don't. If a customer buys you a shot, take it. The bosses get paid and you develop relationships with customers that turn into regulars. I've done the job in three states, in one you couldn't drink behind the bar at all, that sucked. In another it was fine as long as you were below .08, and one that let you do it til your hearts content as long as you weren't 'visibly intoxicated'."

5.0,"People who have gotten turned down from publication, what did your writing lack that led you to getting turned down?[SEP]I've been turned down hundreds of times. Perhaps thousands. I've also sold stories for publication. I've talked to multiple editors and am friends with some... a story isn't always turned down because the writing lacked something. There are times when the story is too similar to others the editor has read and perhaps purchased. Or perhaps it's just not to their taste in the same way that some well written books aren't to everyone's tastes. But I'm very certain I've been turned down numerous times because the quality wasn't as strong as other submissions. This is usually the reason - for me, at least. I've been given feedback at times that made the point clear, so it's not just conjecture. Most of the time, of course, there is never feedback because there is a high volume of submissions to any market and too little time for personal responses in most cases. And that's simply how things are. But regardless of why I've been turned down, you will also be turned down... for your own reasons that may be similar to mine. It can be for reasons that are both rational and irrational. But we must keep writing, improving our craft, and submitting. And submitting. And submitting. Getting turned down is what we authors all have in common - from the greatest of us to the least. Persistence is of the highest value to us... perhaps more so than even creativity itself."
4.0,"How beneficial have writing conferences or similar events been for you?[SEP]I've found some writing conventions very beneficial, and others less so. I'd say conventions that are focused on the genres you want to write in are more likely to be useful than general writing conventions. Depending on your personality you may strike up friendships and start to build relationships that could be very useful in your writing career. Even just being around other creative people can be very energising. You may also learn useful things from the presenters. A short story magazine editor did a Q&amp;A session at a convention I was at some years ago. I asked him what the best piece of advice he would give to any writer hoping to submit to his magazine was. He said ""Delete the first line of your story."" And went on to explain how a lot of writers try to use the first line as an introduction to the story, when it's really not needed and they should just let the story start without an introduction. When I got home I looked at the story I was working on and saw he was absolutely correct. I deleted that first line that I'd put too much effort into and it worked so well that I ended up selling that story to the editor's magazine!"

5.0,"What is your favorite song(s)?[SEP]As of now, “cowboy like me” and “no body, no crime” by Taylor Swift."
5.0,Any advice for getting through a hard week?[SEP]Focus on just one day at a time. What you have to get done that day and what you want to get done that day. See what things you enjoy that you can fit in as well. Like music? Blast some loud music on your drive Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday give yourself enough time for a long hot shower or some other relaxing thing you enjoy. Thursday just focus on school and get what you can done. I've not had my wisdom teeth removed so I got no advice for Friday but I'm guessing that you may be too loopy to worry about it being a bad week so you may actually end up mentally relaxing a bit. Take it one day at a time and squeeze in a few things you enjoy that you can look forward to. Even the little things. Then when the week is over then it's all over and you can move on and be so very happy that week is behind you.
3.0,What's something that took you way too many times to figure out than it should have?[SEP]holy shit hahah ok so i used to think it was okay to just rub body wash or a bar of soap on myself without a rag or a loofa or anything to get clean... that’s how i took showers for an embarrassingly long time... it wasn’t until my early 20s when i realized i spent more time washing dirty dishes than my own body that i finally put the concept together lmfao

5.0,"ELI5: How did wheels work before we invented wheel bearings?[SEP]Yes they relied on two surfaces rubbing together, and yes those surfaces were often greased. A lot (probably the majority) of rotating objects still rely on plain bearings with sliding contact like this. Regarding the resistance, note that the sliding surface is quite a small diameter, and cart wheels tend to be very large. This means that the sliding distance for a given travel distance is quite small, so the effective resistance is quite low. This also helps to reduce wear. Another solution to wear is to make one part sacrificial, often this is a bush or pillow block. This part is made of softer material than the other so wears faster. This can be replaced periodically, and reduces wear on the harder, retained part. Some woods (and plastics) are also self lubricating and so prized for this purpose. For example submarines are or were until recently made with lignum vitae shaft bearings."
2.0,People who leave their used Keurig cups in the machines at work - why are you the way that you are?[SEP]Nothing ruins my day like that. /s This is nothing compared to someone taking all but the last ounce of coffee from the pot so they can say they didn't empty it because they're too lazy to rinse it and start a new pot for someone else.
2.0,"You're headed to a deserted island for a year with all of your basic needs met and a tv with a DVD player, but there is a 50% chance you'll be left there forever. What 5 movies are you bringing with you?[SEP]Cast Away Cast Away Cast Away Cast Away Cast Away"
3.0,"What’s the best story you’ve been told by a family member or friend?[SEP]A buddy of ours told us a story about him and another friend of his walking drunk one afternoon through some rural part of our town. (Some back roads) and found a well sitting in what looked like an empty property. They looked down the well and couldn't see the bottom. My buddy looks over and found a big ass heavy post just laying on the ground with some chain wrapped around it. So, him and his friend decided to pick up the post and throw it in the well. Unknown to them some ways down at the end of the chain wrapped around the post was a freaking goat, and this poor animal was dragged down the well. I'm not sure how true his story is. But he tells it In detail pretty often. Seems like some crazy shit he'd do. Not really the BEST story but definatly the biggest one that made me go ""the fuck?"""
4.0,"How would you go about deep cleaning an extremely messy house by yourself? How do you prevent getting burn out? What cleaning tips do you have?[SEP]The best cleaning tip i ever learned is this. Whenever you move from a room to another, do one task. Be it an empty glass, a piece of thrash, dirty clothes, clean clothes just laying there, washing the stove, counters name it. Doing so is so easy, just a few seconds of your time, but it helps keeping things clean all year round. As for cleaning a extremely messy house, i can only speak about a room, but in my teenagers i was a depressive mess. Overate and kept trash in my room. It got so bad, i had empty potato chips ,candy bars bag , soda bottles, cans, dirty clothes all around the floor. Once, it got to the point where the only"" clean"" space was enough room for me curled up on the bed. My parents cleaned that oned and i cried quietly in my room for a while , they never spoke a word of it,but i knew it was just love. I got this messy a couple other times, and well cleaning up involves kicking your ass up. Put some music you like . Then just make a list, have it like this. 1- Pick up trash ( this is where you get one or multiple trash bag and just dump everything that you wont keep in it. 2. - Pick up items that you will keep. Clean them, and move them out of the room you are in. 3. - Dust off walls/ furniture 4. - Sweep/vacuum 5.- Wash the walls/furniture/ floor 6- Put items you keep back at their place im the room. And do that one room at a time, you'll get a clean house eventually if you keep using the first tip i gave here. Now make that list for every room, and use it as a tool to help you progress. I know it seems stupid,but checking each boxes on each step when you're done is very rewarding. And to avoid burning out, but still get it done, make sure that everytime you have some free time, begin by doing one single task on the list. Any of those task doesnt take more than 45 minutes, and see after that if you feel like doing one more or then use your free time for hobbies or to relax! Now if you're asking on how to clean like what products to use or techniques, google is a very good professor , better than the advices i could give you."
3.0,What will you never be able to accept?[SEP]That my daughter is gone and isn't coming nack
5.0,"What are some tips for a burnt out student?[SEP]If your sensation is of being *overwhelmed* (i.e. you have an impossible amount of work to do with no end in sight) more than *burnt out* (you are exhausted and becoming detached from the work), then two tips: 1. Realise that it's not infinite. If you stick it out until graduation (and I hope you do!), then many of the problems you're accumulating will be wiped clear. Perhaps your GPA/final grade won't be as good as you want, but remember that whatever you're facing now - this too shall pass. Knowning that there is an inevitable light at the end of the tunnel is useful for me. 2. Make a list. If you are the under-organised type, making a list of things to do each morning on a sheet of paper dramatically reduces the stress level that those items cause you. You can implement some fancy to-do software if you prefer but tbh a daily todo is simpler and more effective..."
4.0,"is it possible for something to have no name?[SEP]Your argument assumes that we need to name things in order to refer to them, but that's just false. Demonstratives, for example (e.g., *this* and *that*) allow us to refer to things even without names for them. But virtually every academic discipline encounters phenomena that isn't yet named and then generates names for them. For instance, there was a time when we didn't have a name for complex or transfinite numbers. Then we realized what these kinds of numbers can do, and so we developed names for them. You see something similar with moral and ethical issues. Prior to the middle ages, people really didn't have the concept of a person having a right to something. That changed with the enlightenment. Prior to the '70s, we didn't have a name for sexual harassment. Then Camitta Wood coined the term to name the experience that she suffered at her job. Etc."
4.0,"What are sources on (non-existend) empathy and altruism in society?[SEP]I think one issue you may be running into is that your questions are trying to identify both the individual(human) and socio-political or historic reasons for harmonious coexistence. To me, these are distinct and unique investigations that require new research questions to address individually. On the broader question of why or how to make more stable/harmonious societies, Acemoglu and Robinson’s [Why Nations Fail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail) is an excellent and thorough look on this. Extractive societies (read formerly colonized) that don’t implement extensive reforms to distribute resources more equitably often result is extreme inequality and subsequent social instability. I would also recommend looking at indigenous societies and their modes of non-hierarchical and ecologically-sustainable governance as counter-examples to this."
3.0,What is something you are extremely good at but absolutely can't stand having to do?[SEP]I am extremely adapted being struck by a fire engine at inconvenient times. It's not something I enjoy.
4.0,"ELI5: Why does adblocker work on websites like YouTube but not on streaming services like Hulu?[SEP]Adblockers work on websites by analyzing URLs and HTML to spot the ads. There are only so many ad services, so it's easy to catalog and blacklist most of them. And for YT in particular, someone has figured out the URLs and HTML code YT uses for the ads so it can filter them out. YT could force ads if they chose, by delivering ads the same way they deliver the video, but they have not chosen to do this (yet). Adblockers don't work for streaming because it's not URLs and HTML, it's a video stream that's difficult for an Adblocker to analyze (the same reason it took a long time to have self-driving cars: computer vision is difficult). Also, most people don't stream from a web browser where an Adblocker can operate. If you're using a native app or a smart TV / streaming stick or box, then an Adblocker can't have access to the video stream anyway."
5.0,"Despite the negativity in the current world, what is an experience you've had that reaffirmed your faith in humanity?[SEP]Maybe all of the small interactions I have had recently. Re meeting my past roommate and some other old friends to still know that they kept the same values they believed back then, but still growing as people. Everyone I have met recently was also just delightful. If new people are always great, even after you know them a little more, maybe the world isn’t made of assholes, you know?"
4.0,"National/state guard or reserve members, what’s your experience been like? How’s basic? How’s the training?[SEP]Not at all what the recruiter made it sound like. I’m a medic and spent the first 9 years attached to an Engineer unit with one deployment. I spend most drills on my phone, reading or finding a nice place to nap. I spent nine months in the desert. Nothing exciting happened. My unit wasn’t even deployed as engineers, they were security forces for a base. They stared at sand. I sat in a clinic and did sick call. I’ve been to a lot of cool schools - Mountain Warfare is a blast if you like mountaineering. JRTC was a nightmare with wild horses and no showers. Basic was underwhelming, it was more about being tired and shutting up than anything else. Don’t get me wrong, I love my people and training can be fun, but the day to day involves a lot of incompetent leadership, boredom and short bursts of chaos. Édit: autocorrect is in French, it got confused."
2.0,What do you think will become of India?[SEP]They'll recover. Lots of deaths though.
4.0,"Writing exercises for when you're struggling to come up with the meat around your story's bones?[SEP]Any story premises on characters talking feels risky, because they usually become mouthpieces for various ideas. It’s usually not interesting. The problem you’re facing may stem from that. Your summary isn’t exactly a plot. A plot emerges from itself - actions happen because of the actions that preceded them. Fairy tales are a good example. A family was starving so they sold their decrepit cow. Jack, taking the cow to market, sells the cow for magic beans. When he realizes he’s been scammed, he plants the magic beans, from which grows a magical beanstalk. Etc etc. Your story, right now, doesn’t seem to have an internal engine. What do the characters want and do? What do they talk about? You’re trying to put meat on something that, right now, doesn’t seem to even be a skeleton."
2.0,"What does Mark Zuckerberg keep in its pocket?[SEP]Trick question, he cut a hole in his pocket so he can play with his dick."
3.0,What's a word that you whole heartedly believe should be spelt differently?[SEP]February It also annoys me that the “Las” Las Vegas and “Los” Los Angeles sound the same but are spelt (or spelled? Now I’m confused 😅) differently
5.0,"What are the coolest levels ever in any video game?[SEP]Effect and Cause in Titanfall 2. That game's campaign is great gameplay-wise because each level kind of has its own gimmick that's introduced and then goes away before it overstays its welcome, and Effect and Cause definitely had the coolest gimmick and did the most with it. Just brilliant level design and fitting the time-travel mechanic into the gameplay."
4.0,"What, if anything, will make the social media influencer bubble burst.. and when?[SEP]Yeah, Facebook is going to fade away eventually like MySpace did. I keep reading that the younger generation doesn't do it because they view it as something that is old and something their parents do. I read that the average age on there now is like 40. The only thing I do is Twitter. I like it because people there generally don't act like idiots and there is a lot more news there. Eventually someone will think of something better the more technology evolves."
4.0,What is your unique physiological or biological trait?[SEP]I can stick my penis in my ass.
5.0,"What's the deal with Rick and Morty? There's so much polarizing news about it, is it good or bad?[SEP]It’s a very entertaining show with an unfortunately vocal minority of toxic fans. The show isn’t only understood by those “with an evolved sense of humour” or any of that shit that some losers try and claim, it’s a funny show made by someone with a solid resume of making good shows. The popularity of the show forces the memes to get old fast (Szechuan sauce, pickle Rick, Show Me What You Got, nihilism, etc) but if you can watch the show without focusing on the outside influence from the community it’s pretty good."
4.0,"From what source(s) do you get your news? Do you consider these sources biased or unbiased?[SEP]I will consider anything that is NOT a know parody site, like the Onion, The Daily Mash, or the Babylon Bee. However I will not even bother with sites that are know to be purveyors of wrong and misleading information, such as OAN, Infowars, Wonket, Breitbart, Fox news and anything associated with it. I find that AP news, Reuters, ABC News, PBS, CBS are usually pretty good at being factual."
4.0,"Can one use said one’s free will in any way other than by / with using said one’s own body and mind?[SEP]Technically, (and this is purely a semantic loophole) you could do absolutely nothing. You're technically not using your body or mind (other than the automatic processes that go on without your control [heart beating, cells dividing, etc]). But I'd guess that's not exactly the intent of your question. Unless there's a way that we haven't thought of yet, our bodies and minds are our only way of interacting with anything in the physical world. Free will is a glorified (and necessary) illusion. Everything you are and all of the actions you take are predetermined by previous stimuli. Who you've interacted with, what you've consumed (physically and mentally), etc. You (and everyone else) reacts to a situation based on past knowledge. But, without that illusion, we'd feel trapped. It may be an illusion, but it's a necessary one. You could dip into the realm of pseudoscience, but a lot of those sorts of topics don't have much scientific backing (hence being classified as pseudoscience). And, final point, using free will to choose to not use your body or mind would be ""using your mind"". The choice itself to not do so would inherently be defeating the question, as any action you took after the decision would also have to include that decision when discussing it."
4.0,"People are amazing, what are some experiences you've had with amazing people?[SEP]A friend telling me to stop stressing all the time and just enjoy the world. Things work out. Don't live miserably for no reason. Completely changed how I saw the world"
2.0,Broke thermostat off the wall. How to fix. If not fixable how much will it cost?[SEP]It shouldn't be too difficult. What do you see in the place where the thermostat was?
5.0,"ELI5: how are pop songs with single artists made?[SEP]I'm not an expert in this but I had to learn about it in a music class a while ago. Basically a LOT of it depends on the artist. There are ghost writers and other people that will write songs and sell them off to an artist or record company in which case the artist is usually just doing vocals/playing an instrument. However there is a bit of controversy about doing that kind of thing in some communities and instead musical artists are often expected to do everything on their own with maybe some help from a producer. If they have help from a producer then the artist is usually the one singing/playing an instrument while a producer would go in and put it all together, mix it, and/or add in some more beats. Overall, it really just depends on the artist and even their contract with a music record (if they have one) as they can also have some influence over what an artist creates."
4.0,"In what ways have your parents or family or loved ones sacrificed for you?[SEP]Both my parents really dedicated their lives to making sure my sister and I had a great childhood. Looking back, it was definitely a “kids first” household. We always had amazing Christmases, birthdays, and got to participate in any camps or extracurriculars we wanted to. Our parents never judged us for our interests; they only encouraged us. At one point, they even got divorced because I think the strain of being parents was just too much for them. Fortunately they’re back together now, though! Edit: I promise neither my sister nor I take this for granted. We absolutely adore our parents and are very close with them. We spend time with them whenever we can. We fully understand how lucky we are."
5.0,"Retail workers, what is the ONE nightmare customer story you always tell people?[SEP]It was my second day on the floor working at drive through coffee chain. Might I also add it was my first job so I had no experience with anything to do with cash registers and the speedy nature of it. Now it was a mid shift maybe around 4PM when we had a customer order a few things though the drive through and as I was handing him his change I accidentally miscounted and gave him one less dollar bill I didn't even realize I did so . Well at least I didn't know until he came barging into the lobby screaming and yelling accusing me of short changing him every time he is there (once again my second day there but apparently it's been a couple weeks this has been happening) went off on how I'm a crack head and shouldn't be working with money and all that . I just stood there like a deer in headlights as I had no idea what even happened until he said I gave him a dollar less. The shift leader gave him a dollar and he went on his way. Told me to not worry about it as it was the first day I was on register and second day working there ."
3.0,"What’s the longest you can hold your breath? Do you want to improve this, and why?[SEP]I actually keep track of my best times on a sticky note. 1:34 A minute and thirty four seconds"
3.0,"Annoying tropes to avoid when writing a female character?[SEP]In one of the Anne Rice books Lestat’s vampire body is stolen and he wakes up in a human body - he demonstrates at first confusion and then annoyance at human body needs like urinating and disgust at needing to defecate. I can see your guy getting up and going to the bathroom, reaching for his penis and panicking because it’s not there. Now he has to urinate sitting down. Ditto on trying to put on a bra (and this could be Hollywood funny) but I also see him reacting in a male way to harassment which I would enjoy to read. I’m also an interested in where you go with him - how long is he a female, how does he choose to present himself? As a feminine female? As a butch female - you could put him in a beautiful female body but make him shave his head and Butch himself out. Lots of permutations in female form."
4.0,"What is a pun/joke that you made up and thought was original, but later you found out already existed?[SEP]When facebook started to become a big thing I was in fifth grade. Apparently smacking peoples faces with books and screaming ""facebook"" isn´t quite as original as I had thought. God damn I hate fifth graders..."
2.0,What is the most ridiculous or irritating word phrases you hear in your corporate job?[SEP]You name it. As a society as a whole we have gone insane with ways to word things that you need to try to puzzle out. Why can't we just call things what they are.
2.0,How do you stay positive when you see many negative things?[SEP]Do things to make you happy
4.0,What is this song looking for?[SEP]I’ve had this song stuck in my head since late 2000s I have never found the song online I have tried my google searches can’t match anything. The lyrics either go: “and it’s feels going on and on alright alright alright alright” or the chorus is “tonight tonight tonight tonight” it’s sung by a female artist kind of sounds like avril Laverne. I know the song exists because I heard it on the radio while on working at my past work.Any help would be great!
5.0,"What's ur creepiest urban legend?[SEP]There's this one hotel. Everyone who's ever tried to renovate it has failed miserably. It's been completely un-fixable ever since the fire, and everyone's scared to even try. Now it just sits there, like a grim landmark. There's another cursed building in Altamonte Springs. The I-4 eyesore. One dude a long time ago supposedly got a message from god that he had to build this huge tower. Alot of the people who've worked on it have died, and I don't think it's ever actually gonna be complete. So yeah, Florida has it's fair share of cursed landmarks. ANd I only listed the major two that I know."
4.0,"Do sociopaths and psychopaths yawn when other people yawn?[SEP]Probably not, that’s the perfect time for them to get busy being a psychopath."
3.0,"A new ice cream is invented based upon your personality, what’s its flavour?[SEP]Embrace the Void by Jen and Berry"
4.0,"What's a movie/tv show/book/game that you love, from a genre that you normally dislike?[SEP]While not in ""Love"" terms. I do like the Frozen Films and The Little Mermaid (I'm not into Musicals that much)"
5.0,Where can I find research on the effects of gender roles on relationships?[SEP]YES! What a great educator. Thank you for all you do for future generations. I think you can find many articles on gender roles in relationships like these: [https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/cjfy/index.php/cjfy/article/view/29619](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/cjfy/index.php/cjfy/article/view/29619) [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1066480717731342](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1066480717731342) AND I think you can learn a \*lot\* about gender roles when looking at the queer community. Especially non-binary and trans relationships because often the LGBTQ+ community has had to spend more time thinking about gender and relationships. Like this one: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2018.1531281](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2018.1531281) [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217723883](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217723883)
2.0,"What would be your last wish?[SEP]Id wish for, that i had made at least one person in this world happy."
5.0,"What do you do when you don't feel like doing anything?[SEP]Try listening to music that might elicit a feeling from you, like sad or angry or energetic. Or, lie on your bed for 20 minutes (set a timer on your phone). Not long enough for me to fall asleep, but long enough to clear my mind. Works best if you are already showered/dressed for the day, your bed is made and you lie on top of it. It's like an adult time-out or reset."
4.0,"What Story that sounds fake actually happened to you?[SEP]Okey here is one i can actually talk about. In my local area there is a very clean freshwater fountain/river area, with a outside wooden strucure, the water is so nice and cold that people come from all around the area to go there and fillkanisters with water. Right next to that place there is a big Picknick place on one side (you have to cross a small bride 6-7m length to get over the river to the Picknick area) and on the other side of the river there is the freshwater fountain that has the river with the brindge behind it and a steep cliff like area next to it and than some parking spaces. Well i was i think 9 or 10 or something at the time, and i was looking at this cliff like area and it had these every steep stairs and i imagined people using the stairs to climb up there. Basically these stairs aren't stairs of all but they are meant to stop debree stones and similar to fall down. Well i didn't know that at the time. I just thought to myself well if people climb up their regulary why can't I do that, i just really wanted to do it, so while my parents where picknicking i just went there and started to climb up like 10 ish meters, looking back at it, it makes no sense i even have fear of heights, why would I do that? It was mossy wet and dangerous because there were big stones everywhere"
5.0,"ELI5: Old cities have been excavated that are covered in soil from years of neglect/abandonment. Sometimes from quite deep underground. Where does the soil come from?[SEP]There are many sources. The first layers of dirt is usually from the collapsing buildings themselves. The walls, roofs and furniture will collapse and rot creating a layer of debris that covers most thing. In some cases there are city fires speeding up the process. A lot of buildings also tends to be built on top of older buildings which have collapsed or burned so even a city that is being lived inn will grow upwards covering the older parts of the city with newer buildings. But there are also a lot of other things that cause cities to be buried further and further. Winds blow harder on mountain tops and erodes away the soil and rock which then gets deposited in the valleys where there is not as much wind. Similarly rivers carries dirt and sediments from the steeper mountains where the water flows fast and deposits them on the planes where the rivers are much calmer. Especially during floods a lot of soil is carried from the mountains down into the valleys where the cities are."
4.0,What is the most American thing you have ever seen or done?[SEP]....a donut double cheeseburger (as in the buns were donuts)
4.0,"What have your experiences with gambling been like?[SEP]I moved to Vegas about 3 years ago. If I drop $200 and lose it all over 4 or 5 hours I still had fun for an entire night and consider it breaking even. If I come out ahead, then sweet. If I lose it all in 1 or 2 hours then that kind of sucks."
4.0,"Tinnitus sufferers, what do you do to cope?[SEP]Noise, music or rain and thunderstorm sounds while im going to sleep. I use earbuds for music on my work because my earplugs damp sounds so far that i only hear a ringing sound and can't even understand my colleagues."
4.0,"What was your most embarrassing airplane/ airport experience?[SEP]Had a layover in Switzerland once and to get on the next plane you had to show your passport at the gate once again. I greeted the gal with a casual greeting in German, she responded in kind and kept going……..and I realized my German had seriously deteriorated over the past thirty plus years. Had to switch to English and apologize. Made her laugh, though."
4.0,"People born in the 90's, what was the first thing you did when you discovered Internet?[SEP]I remember searching ""Metallica"" cause I was such a huge fan, and still am.... For the record, I was born in '82."
4.0,"What do you think the factory settings of a human would be?[SEP]My guess is pretty much a blank slate, probably not even capable of speech"
4.0,"If someone from the middle ages miraculously appeared in 2021, what event/technology/idea would take the most time to explain?[SEP]Absolutely the internet. There's no way you could explain something that deep and fast paced in whole in one sitting. An infinite source of knowledge that we use to watch animals do funny stuff and argue with people we will never meet. Not to mention memes"
3.0,"People who ended up with someone WAY out of your league, how the hell did it happen?[SEP]I really don't know. I'm actually at a complete loss as to how or why she decided to go out with me. I mean, we had similar personalities and hobbies but that still doesn't explain why she went for a guy like me when they were much better looking guys right there. Honestly? Literally the only explanation I can come up with which is a little far-fetched is the fact that I actually made a demonic pact a couple years back when I was in a desperate situation. I'm not going to go into the specifics of a pact, let's just say that I got almost everything I wanted but in the worst way possible. If this is true, it's definitely proof that the devil exists and that he actually is interested in owning a human soul but that pack comes with a really nasty price tag guys and that price tag at least in my case is a bunch of really shitty luck the balance out you getting what you never should have gotten in the first place. Oh no I've said too much."
4.0,"Retail workers, what are some of your horror stories of working with bad/entitled customers?[SEP]This actually happened yesterday. I'm wheeling the hand trolley moving something heavy when a lady shoves something wooden in my hands demanding a price. I don't really look at it because of the hand trolley and say I'm heading out the back so I'll see about a price. Once I get out the back I pass it to my manager while I deal with the trolley. He asks why I gave it to him. I say a customer found it wants a price. That's when I properly see what I handed over. A SHELF! SHE TOOK OFF ONE OF OUR SHELVES FROM THE WALL AND WANTED TO BUY IT. We put a not for sale sticker just cos and I explained that she couldn't have it because well it's ours and a f&amp;%king shelf. She then gets snappy saying she needs it and doesn't see why I can't sell it. AGAIN I say no and it's ours then walk off. She complains loudly to her friend about how the one thing she wanted she can't have!"
4.0,"What is considered weird in the society, but you think ""its pretty normal""?[SEP]A man sitting down to pee. In public, eh. But in your home or someone else's, I think it's cleaner and courteous. Plus you get to chill for a moment. And no I'm not talking about aim when I say cleaner. Your pee splashes when it hits the water or the bowl. So you get a little pee splash zone around your toilet."
3.0,What cartoon do you still like to watch?[SEP]Dbz. South Park.
5.0,What are some of the most detailed dreams you saw and remember while sleeping ?[SEP]Dreams where things crashed into me or clung onto me. One dream my brother was clinging to me while I was riding my bike and I kicked him off like a savage. I ended up kicking the ceiling and cut up my toes. I was top bunk as a kid. More recent jump dream was a car accident where I was a pedestrian. I tried jumping out of the way and jumped from my bed. Woke up with cold sweats.
4.0,"What's The creepiest thing that's happened to you that you still think about to this day?[SEP]I was sitting in Trafalgar Square in London waiting for a friend and this guy came up to me claiming to be a photographer. He said he had a studio nearby and asked if I’d come and have my picture taken there. I told him I was meeting someone/didn’t have time and he insisted. He kept saying it isn’t far away and that wouldn’t take long and he’d pay me in cash. He was being weirdly pushy about it and wouldn’t take no for an answer. He was also dressed like a tourist, like he definitely didn’t look like a photographer (not that I know what a photographer looks like). He only left me alone once my friend arrived but something about the whole interaction made me really uneasy so I did some googling and found [this article](https://www.google.co.nz/amp/s/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/amp/entry/sex-trafficking-victim-talks-about-modern-slavery-in-london_uk_5be941e5e4b0769d24cf04a5/) about a girl in central London who had ended up in a sex trafficking ring because a guy in the street had tricked her into thinking he was a photographer/model scout."
5.0,"What is a scary thing that happened to you?[SEP]I was driving home for the weekend from college, about a 2 hour drive through bumfuck-nowhere minnesota at about 2am. I’m the only car on the interstate until I pass a car on the shoulder. I blow by it at 80mph, and I see it’s headlights flash in my rear view. It quickly catches up to me from a standstill and rides my ass for 2-3 minutes then slams on it’s brakes and I leave it in the dust. It then gets back up to speed and passes me to get in front of me. I don’t let it pin me down and work to get back in front. It slows way down again and catches up to me over and over for about 60 miles until I can get to the 24 hour casino. I got off on the exit and he kept going. No idea what the driver wanted but I worry what would have happened had I needed gas in the middle of nowhere or if s/he had gotten me stopped on the road. Freaked me out"
4.0,What musical artist/band are you surprised that are no longer around?[SEP]Daft Punk. That one hit me hard.
4.0,"What is, including ingredients and cooking instructions, your favorite recipe?[SEP]Got this recipe from an app and I keep playing with it, for probably-bastardized but delicious yellow curry: 1 medium yellow onion 1 medium sweet potato OR like half a pound of carrots 1 good inch-sized knob fresh ginger 2 cloves garlic 1-2 habanero peppers (I remove the seeds and don’t even put these in always) 1 can coconut milk (unsure ounces here, standard size??) 2 Tablespoons curry powder 4 good sized chicken thighs or similar amount of other chicken cut 1 cup dry basmati rice Some cooking oil, I use 50/50 olive and sesame when I make this First, take your veggies and similar (sweet potato/carrot, onion, ginger, garlic, peppers) and pulse them a few times in a food processor so that they are pretty tiny and beginning to blend together well, but definitely not turning into veggie cream. Heat a skillet over medium and add your cooking oil when hot, then add those veggies. Cook for like 3-5 minutes to soften - while they cook, chop your chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Add the coconut milk and curry powder to your pan, stir well to blend. Bring it to a boil, then add the chicken and simmer over medium heat until the chicken is done, about 20 minutes. I start the basmati rice about the same time I add the chicken, and put the rice and the curry side by side in a bowl while serving so you can mix them or eat a bite of either by itself."
3.0,"ELI5: Do birds fly for days while over the ocean? How do they sleep?[SEP]Hope I'm not too late for this one. Sailor here, we've had birds try and land on our ship for rest. But we don't carry food for them, so eventually we'll just have a few bird carcasses we have to push/wash overboard. Or if they try to rest near a radar or communication system to stay away from humans, they just get cooked due to the radiation. Nothing we can really do about it."
4.0,"IIL Kurupt FM Garage Music WWIL?[SEP]Absolutely start listening to [Rinse FM](https://rinse.fm). Started as a pirate station in London then went legit, they have shows that range from classic jungle/garage/2 step to modern rave/house type music, but it's all jams and incredible DJs. It's how I've found the best UK underground music over the years"
5.0,"What was your biggest ""I TOLD YOU SO"" moment?[SEP]There was a huge brawl around the pubs in my village. 10 people came out of the club and got into 2 awaiting taxis. The taxis rolled away a few feet and some of the guys hopped out of the moving taxis to go swinging on some people. Hopping in and out and the taxi was trying to gtfo but couldn’t let anyone hanging out of the cars get hurt. So there’s already a few people knocked out in the street and my friend said he wanted to go over for a better look. I was on the corner filming and could see it all fine. I advised him not to. As I’m filming I see another body drop in a seated position about to get up. I was like is that my boy Mike? I think he got hit again. After things cleared up and people stumbled or got dragged away, he comes up to me asking how his face looked. He got his brow split and his dad who’s a dr gave him stitches after he got home. I told him not to get close. It was a slugfest."
4.0,"Why are you not loving yourself ? Why don't you start treating yourself as You treat something or someone you love ?[SEP]Because even though I've come so far, I've still not reached my goals. Patience is hard after having stalled for so many years, and all the effort and pain I've been through feels worthless the moment I stop making progress. As for the second question, I don't feel that strongly about anything."
4.0,"What's that thing that's useless to everyone but extremely useful to you?[SEP]My organs, unless someone takes them 😅"
4.0,"When you apply for a job, how restricted do you feel by the ""required qualifications"" they list? Will you apply for one if you don't quite meet them 100%?[SEP]As a hiring manager I straight up expect every candidate to NOT have every ‘required’ qualification. The jobs I hire for often require a disparate skill set, and generally at early professional level (think 3-5 years of work experience.) What I look for is the ability to learn, be adaptable and bring a good attitude to the organization. Obviously they need to be able to do the basics of the work and I test for that but if they bring the first three soft-skills and can do the hiring exercise proficiently I’ll send them up to the final round (at this point it becomes a smaller panel interview where we test for personality and compatibility.) I strongly - STRONGLY - urge people (particularly women and POC, who are statistically less likely to apply to a role unless they hit every bullet) to apply to jobs they are interested in but aren’t 100% qualified for. Hiring managers are generally not insane and look for people that are engaged, curious and open-minded. The worst case scenario is that you get more experience interviewing, and a potential connection for the future. The best case is that you literally get the job!"
4.0,"How do I improve my non-existent personality?[SEP]You’ve been through a lot and seem to be growing as a person. Be kind to yourself and give yourself a break. You said you find yourself becoming more interested in things so expose yourself to different outlets and see what grabs your interest. Read the newspapers, watch documentaries, take a class each semester that is very different, read travel blogs... keep an open mind and when something grabs your interest, pursue it. You’ll grow your own stories and befriend others with similar interests."
4.0,"[Star Wars] How many Padawans does an average human Jedi train?[SEP]I think Master and Apprentice had some info on whether it was actually a requirement or not. As for a gap, that’s left to the discretion of the master and the council. Some may want to dive right into another student, some may never want to train another. In regards to the time it takes, that’s also kind of a wide range. You have some that may spend 15 years as a Palawan or more and then there are a few that cleared it in under 10. Anakin was especially precocious but Ashoka was also incredibly gifted (I think she left the order at 16-17 and was considered knight worthy by then if I’m not mistaken). Also, consider how many people of age you see and how many of them just don’t have combat potential and go into other areas like researchers, librarians, groundskeepers. Not everyone who’s gifted with a level of force ability is suited to combat or diplomatic missions so there’s also a factor of how many padawan age kids are actually suited for and want to undergo the training. Edit: I know this doesn’t exactly answer your question. There’s just a lot that goes into it."
2.0,What is something that you regret and why?[SEP]Not sticking a fork in it yet
4.0,"What’s the worst example of a Karen you’ve ever witnessed?[SEP]I once went to a festival with my aunt and her friends family. It was in a remote location with few options for dining. When we entered the only restaurant left with any space for us, the girl at the counter told us that we might have to wait a bit as the restaurant is packed with people dining in and ordering take outs. Around 20 minutes later, my aunt makes her way to the counter, cuts in line and demanded to speak to the manager. I had to stand there with an apologetic look as she went on hysterics about how bad the service there was and how long she had been waiting for our food."
4.0,"People that are asking the same weird questions every 5 seconds, why are you doing that?[SEP]There are definitely some spammers here, yeah. That ""cute fluffy cat"" guy, the guy who asks about wholesome YouTube channels, The ""What is love"" guy... I'm wondering about this too. I guess they're probably either dedicated trolls or they have a condition or something. But it's getting more common. They keep making new alts when they get banned too so that's not ideal."
5.0,"How can I be more confident?[SEP]Find one thing you like about yourself. Just one. The world is so unkind as it is, so we can’t bring that home with us. We have to be a little kinder to ourselves. We need to take an extra long shower, spend that extra $2 on the good shampoo, give ourselves a little smile in the mirror, or just watch a movie we want to watch. Do kind things for yourself. Find something to like about yourself, even if it’s just one thing. If there are things you hate that you can change, look into what it would take to actually change it. You can get a haircut. You can whiten teeth. You can lose / gain weight. You can grow nails. There’s a lot you can change. For the things you can’t change, learning to love yourself as is doesn’t really work. If you dislike something then you dislike it. What we can do much easier is learn to tolerate it. To eventually come to the ‘meh’ mindset where you just don’t care because you have so many other great qualities. You just start with finding one good thing. As for confidence, fake it. If you act confident, people will believe you’re confident and you will eventually feel more confident which leads to truly being more confident. Fake it till you make it."
3.0,"You have to show someone a televison or movie scene that will give them goosebumps, what do you show them?[SEP]Stranger things season 4 when billy is in that sauna room oh my god the acting is incredible in that scene"
2.0,"If Brain Transplant was possible, who would be saved? The Donor or the one in need of a new Brain?[SEP]The donor. Because theoretically the consience is in the brain. So it would be the donor in the body of the reciever. Techinically in this situation, its more of a body donour"
4.0,"When was the last time you tried something new? What was it and how'd it turn out?[SEP]Bought Colombian coffee instead of my usual French roast. Regret is why I hate trying new things, so I hope I learned my lesson."
4.0,"How do you write «hey How are you» in your language??[SEP]Im irish and in irish it’s “dia dhuit, cèn chaoi a bhfuil tù?”"
5.0,"Eli5. How does Professional Wrestling Work?[SEP]Big moves, called ""spots,"" might be practiced beforehand, especially if timing is required. Action between spots may be done on the fly and communicated during rest holds, i.e. headlocks that seem to last five minutes. Wrestling school teaches you how to strike, slam, and fall without hurting yourself or your opponent. Chops to the chest look and sound awful, but the damage is mostly superficial. A wrestler who doesn't pull his punches enough is said to work ""stiff."" Vader and Stan Hansen were two guys notorious for being stiff workers."
5.0,"How do people feel about the QR code’s restaurants are using instead of paper menus?[SEP]Like it. Everyone has a phone with a camera at this point. Let's use the tech we have to eliminate an unnecessary use of paper or plastic or whatever. And, no, I'm not an eco terrorist"
5.0,"What is the worst and or most awkward conversation or interaction you have ever had?[SEP]I knew a kid named Nash in high school. He was a sweet kid in the year below me and we had a couple friendly conversations. I graduated, fast forward a couple years, and I see Nash on my college campus. Turns out we went to the same school. We stopped to chat for a second, and then he put his hand up to give a high five at the end. I thought ""oooookay little strange but sure let's do this"" and I went in for the high five. As soon as my hand connected with Nash's hand, he interlocked his fingers into mine. I had no idea what to do and gracefully noped out of there soon after. My friends and I call this the ""high five to hand hold"" incident."
5.0,"Eli5 How tf do scientists know the ""maps"" of million years old continents?[SEP]There are a couple of things to consider. We know which way the continents are currently moving (and how fast) so we can basically reverse the movement we see to show where they previously were. This also couples with the shapes of the continents - when the shapes broadly correspond it is a good sign that that is how they were previously joined. We can also be a bit more scientific and compare the rock formations we see - our maps show roughly which bits were attached to which bits, and we can quite easily investigate the rock types and formations found at these points to see how they compare. Where they match closely it is a good hint that they were once part of the same landmass and split. You can also do the same with things like fossils - the same as nowadays, certain species lived in certain areas, so matching fossil types at opposite sides of the ocean are another marker to show they were connected."
5.0,"What was the other name your parents had picked out for you before they named you? What was almost your name?[SEP]Emily, but they told my aunt and she named her daughter Emily. So when they were pregnant with me they kept my name a secret and when she asked they told her Mary Elizabeth...so when my cousin was born 6 mo. after me, my aunt named her Elizabeth Mary."
4.0,What is your favorite euphemism?[SEP]~~Drug dealer~~ \- *street pharmacist* ~~Prostitute~~ \- *anatomical sales associate* ~~Sex~~ \- *adult leapfrog* ~~Gay sex~~ \- *crashing the custard truck into the chocolate factory*
4.0,"Serious - Those who are choosing to not find a job and are living on m the enhanced unemployment, why not work? And what would make you want to go back to work?[SEP]I took this time/opportunity to finally become a full time musician. I have worked at least one, sometimes two or three jobs since the age of 16 (now 36) and never got much closer to doing what I wanted to do full time because I was always busy working. And I was still struggling financially. It was usually for not that much money, regardless of staying loyal to different companies for years and gig based jobs as supplement. I was a very hard worker and still saw people around me get promotions and better pay. I have been taken for granted, companies acted like I owe them something for them giving me a job, but never taking me or my personal needs in consideration. I'm done with that lifestyle. I am technically working as a musician but also collecting unemployment and whatever other benefits I can reap. I didn't cause the pandemic/my own unemployment, so why not collect as many benefits as I can? For the first time in a long time, I'm not struggling paycheck to paycheck and wondering how I'm going to afford all my bills and buy food."
4.0,"What is your most find memory with you mother?[SEP]Seventh row, Alice Cooper. We had a blast."
4.0,What's the best way to learn a new language?[SEP]The best way is interaction with people who speak the language. If you can make friends with people who speak the language and are willing to help you learn it is very effective. If you can date someone who speaks the language it is even better. Language courses (online or in class) are ok at teaching basics but to become fluent you need to immerse yourself in the language... you need to actually speak the language with people to learn effectively. If you're not ready to interact with people yet then online learning (duolingo or similar) combined with consumption of media is a good start. For example if you're trying to learn french try french subtitles with english audio or english subtitles with french audio on netflix/primevideo/etc. It can take a while (months) but eventually you start to understand the language fairly well. Practice makes perfect.
3.0,"What is your “average Joe” act of heroism?[SEP]calling out your friends when they’re being shitty. guy in your group talks about getting roofies for some girl who won’t put out? “hey man, that’s fucked up.” friend being a jackass to the cashier because they’re out of xyz? “dude, there’s no reason to yell at the cashier it isn’t their fault” sibling toss trash out the window? pull over, go get it, and “littering is shit behaviour bruh, wtf”"
2.0,"What are the signs of a fake marriage/people remaining in marriage for anything other than love?[SEP]lol.....ppl been getting married for reasons other than love for thousands of years....compatibility is much more important, which is why most divorces are over money not love."
4.0,"People who have no fucking clue what their ""passion"" is - What did you decide to do for a living?[SEP]By accident really. I dropped out of university then took a receptionist job to ensure I could afford to eat while I worked out what the fuck I was going to do... Then someone quit, so I took their job, boss paid for uni course for credentials while working there, and kinda fell into finance from there . I never really decided to work in finance...but hey decent money, so am still in the finance field."
4.0,"What do you think are the differences between Americans and Europeans?[SEP]The biggest difference? The complete lack of understanding and knowledge about anything outside their borders vs well educated society with at least some basic knowledge about the general world political structure, cultures and geography. Also, as far as I can tell, most Americans I've met seem to be completely brainwashed into thinking that the most important US is the only civilised country out there, while the facts are showing it's mostly the other way around in at least half of the countries out there."
3.0,What simply skill did you learn recently do you recommend to others?[SEP]Grammar and spelling is quite SIMPLE. Would recommend
4.0,"Hey, you there, how was your day?[SEP]Started crappy, then got better. I had to work, but didn’t want to be there. Luckily it was pretty slow, we had enough coverage, &amp; I really wasn’t feeling too good anyway, so I got to leave early. I came home, had some lunch, played Animal Crossing for a while with our niece, took a nap, then ate dinner with hubby &amp; spent the rest of the evening watching TV with him. :)"
4.0,"What's the best business tip? Job tips r welcome?[SEP]Having a fun job is better than 100 or 200 dollars more. if you have the choice, take the job that is more fun. fun at work is priceless. if you have a job, that is fun and that you are good at you wont quit and thus earn more in the long run."
3.0,"Can you name 5 books off the top of your head --- in 10 seconds!? Could you do it, and why or why not?[SEP]Yup, because I read a lot."
3.0,"What’s the funniest video you’ve ever seen?[SEP]So you see, there was this Scientist, who was quiet crazy. He and his Nephew decide to visit different Galaxies and Universes. But one time he decided to turn himself into a Pickle. He asks his Nephew to flip him over with a screwdriver, revealing that he is in fact a Pickle now. That's the funniest shit I've seen."
5.0,"Have you bought something from an infomercial? How was your experience?[SEP]Years ago I bought a machine that was meant to support neck and back whilst doing sit-ups, and could nearly fold flat to store it under the bed. What arrived was a terrible constricted contraption made of foam and cheap plastic, that had to be totally dismantled to make it flat. It fell apart after about a week of use."
2.0,what was ruined because too many people started doing it?[SEP]Having sex with my mom.
4.0,"What's the most beautiful word you know and give the definition?[SEP]Pyrrhic. It means hollow, or at a great expense to the point of worthlessness. Most commonly use in conjunction with victory, when an the cost of a victory is so great it takes away any value of winning. Also I love the word incandescent, it means to illuminate through physical heat or emotion. Can be used both about objects and people. It’s sort of like glowing, but just way better."
4.0,"What are your views on DogeCoin? Do you think it will stay?[SEP]Dogecoin doesn't have any future. The majority of online businesses don't accept it and will almost guaranteed never accept it (unlike Bitcoin). It's just a meme at this point and when the hype dies down, so will its value. And it's annoying to see that Reddit's love child and ""the smartest person in the world; Elon Musk"" (quoting Joe Rogan) is advertising the coin, while knowing that a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money on it, when the big guys pull out. Also, seeing the countless of Twitter bots spamming about Dogecoin should be enough proof for everyone that it's a huge scam. And lastly, only 20 wallets own over 50% of Dogecoin. Those are the same people who pay these actors on social media to raise the hype. Elon Musk might be one of them, but I think Elon Musk is more likely riding the wave for PR. Oh yeah, and if this post blows up, watch all the downvotes to my comment. These bots are active everywhere."
4.0,"If all animals could talk, which do you think would provide the most interesting conversation?[SEP]The shadiest of all would be the little birds…telling everyone’s secrets"
5.0,"What's the worst part about your job?[SEP]How people don't communicate and let their assumptions dictate their actions. Too often do I ask if something was done and the response is, ""I assume X is taking care of that."" I then call X to verify and find out that X has absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. It also seems like people in our organization walk away from meetings without a clear course of action for everyone. It's getting to the point where before a meeting ends I stop everyone from leaving to confirm what everyone needs to go do and when they will do it. They get annoyed, but come on! It's a one minute wrap up that has saved us so many times in the past, guys..."
5.0,"Those who have experienced a “miraculous healing” of some kind, what was your experience?[SEP]Don’t know if that counts but I had sprained my ankle very badly in a game got swollen 2 hours after and I couldn’t step on it at all. Had to walk a round the house with crutches. I wasn’t supposed to start feeling better till a week after. Went to a physiotherapist the next day and the mf got rid of the swelling,the pain and made me able to walk again(I was limping cos the foot was still weak but at least I could get rid of the damn crutches). My foot was almost at 90% full recovery the next day and I ended up getting back to action 5 days after my injury. Another time I had overtrained so bad that I developed Patellar Chondropathy which disallowed me from bending my knee to the slightest without feeling excruciating pain. I couldn’t even walk properly. Went to the physiotherapist and surprise surprise I stopped feeling around 70% of the pain by the end of the session. Was ready to play a month later. I still can’t believe it"
4.0,My son turns 5 this month just want know how to have a good birthday when on budget?[SEP]He is 5 so he will probably not have any big wishes. Also during these times just don't invite a whole lot of people.
4.0,"Food delivery drivers, and all others who are used to being tipped with lose change - such as waiters and bartenders - with the advent and rampant popularity of card payments, and a plummet in the amount of cash being carried, have you noticed a decline in tips?[SEP]I use to be a part time delivery driver in college, and I actually noticed that people who paid with cards seemed to tip more than those who paid in cash. Like say I made 20 deliveries and 5 of them tipped on a card. I may make like 20 bucks total from them, but out of the other 15 people I'd only make say 30 bucks total from cash sales. And most times that's cuz some guy decided to be nice and tip a 10 with his meal."
4.0,"ELi5: How does movies get into theaters worldwide? By digitally or still using film?[SEP]Actual film reels are extremely rare now, as nearly all theaters are pure digital and making and shipping film reels is very expensive. Absolutely no one wants to deal in physical film anymore. All digital. Theaters get their movies one of two way: 1) it gets shipped to them on a secure hard drive. 2) it gets sent to them over the internet via a very fast fiber connection."
5.0,"Eli5: why is it safer to let food cool down before putting it in fridge, instead of putting it in hot?[SEP]It's actually less safe for the food you're letting cool. However, it can temporarily raise the temperature of the fridge enough that other food may be at risk of spoiling. Extra steak you cooked that you aren't going to finish? Safer to put straight into the fridge because it doesn't have a whole lot of heat. Large pot of stew that's still piping hot? That has a *ton* of heat that will work your fridge harder and has higher potential to heat up other foods. Most modern fridges are fairly safe unless you're putting a lot of hot food in them. Industrial fridges are even safer because they have such a large amount of cold air within."
4.0,What is one of your fictional crushes and what does it say about your type?[SEP]Gadget Hackwrench. I like practical tomboys who are a little mousy in appearance.
5.0,"It takes courage to admit that you were wrong. What's the biggest thing you've ever been wrong about? What changed your mind?[SEP]About technology being so easy to use. My dad is 71 and I’m a computer-savvy teen (yes I know he’s old to have a child that’s still a teen but it’s fine) I realized that you need to explain things differently to a person who wasn’t born when there were computers and things around. The reason I know everything is that I started using a computer when I was four, and he started using a computer maybe in his... forties/fifties? (Can’t remember when he would have had access to a computer) It’s basically programmed into my mind on how computers work... not so much for dad. I also have to explain it in a different way than if I was explaining it to an already computer-lit person. Don’t get mad at your parents, it’s not that they don’t remember, they just weren’t taught like we were!"
3.0,"Do any indisputable truths exist?[SEP]If I had to write about indisputable truths with those writers, I'd probably start with Leibniz's distinction between Truths of Reason and Truths of Fact. Say that if there is such a thing as an indisputable truth it would have to be a Truth of Reason, rather than a Truth of Fact. Then compare that to [Kant's claim about how 7 + 5 = 12 is true](http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/kant-first-critique-cambridge.pdf). And you can spin out a few pages digging into the difference between: * 7 + 5 = 7 + 5 * 7 + 5 = 12 Is it indisputable that ""12"" and ""7+ 5"" are identical? If so, then etc. If not, then etc. Or go with the other prompt, and ask if it is painfully obvious that ""12"" and ""7 + 5"" are equal. If you still need some pages, write about how recollective math works in [the Meno](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/meno.html). Usually the truthiest truths are truths of math, and Leibniz, Kant, and Plato all deal with math slightly differently. So mucking about in that should spin out a fairly good undergrad paper. Also, don't start your end of year dissertation during finals week."
4.0,"Hey honey, how are you?[SEP]Tbh I was ok until you called me honey"
3.0,Can someone explain what a NFT is and how it works in simple terms?[SEP]Tldr: there are people in the world with too much money so they spend it on useless shit like a digital image that anyone can get and download but you'll have the original
3.0,Whats the best unbeatable combo?[SEP]The Ness wambo combo in smash 64. I hate that fucker.
4.0,"ELI5: If I take oxygen and hydrogen and jam them together they don’t make water. how does water happen?[SEP]Take two Hydrogen atoms, one Oxygen, and add some temperature. Water does happen, you\`ve got the recipe right. I suspect that you\`re hoping to see drops, clouds, or somesuch. It takes a LOT of H and O to make a raindrop. I may have worked this out wrong, but I think that if you completely fill three big hot air balloons (2800 M3 each), one with Oxygen and two with Hydrogen, that would result in only 13.5 Kg of water (or 3.5 gallon - a mid-size bucket). Happy to be corrected on the math!"
4.0,"What is the creepiest town/city you know or know of and why do you find it so creepy?[SEP]Pripyat. 50000 people used to live there, now its a ghost town"
3.0,So who had the best quarantine?[SEP]Everyone who got unemployment and got to stay home.
2.0,"In your opinion, what's the worst crime ever committed?[SEP]The first time my daughter had a KitKat she opened it and took a bite out of it. Just blatantly opened and chomped into it, didn't take a wafer piece off or anything. Heathen. My wife and I just stood there and stared at her. Unbelievable."
4.0,"What was the most cringeworthy dialogue to come out of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films and why?[SEP]“My spider sense is tingling if you know what I’m talking about” or some shit like that, idk, I tried to block out all of the cringe that was the third movie’s Venom"
3.0,What is the most 90's movie?[SEP]Clerks. It's so 90's it hurts.
2.0,"Why do you run so fast?[SEP]You think I run fast?! Ahh, shucks. *Blushes* Thanks man."
5.0,"What are some of your first flight tips?[SEP]In no particular order: Relax. Its basically a louder, heavier, more expensive bus ride that may have drink service. Wear your seat belt when told, listen to the flight attendants, wear a mask, try to get comfortable, and listen to a podcast or whatever. If youre still nervous there are plenty of people like you. There is a reason that there are bars in airports. Avoid getting hammered though. You may not be able to use the bathroom quickly. Air is a lot like water when you're traveling on it. There may be bumps occasionally. That's totally normal and you're completely safe. Pilots and air traffic controllers are trying to keep you on the smoothest ride they can. Finally, to quote Jim Jeffries: Window seat gets one armrest and a view. Middle seat gets two armrests. Aisle seat gets one armrest, and a little extra legroom. We aren't animals. We live in a society."
4.0,"What's something you admire about a different generation?[SEP]The greatest generation. They were far more elegant than we are, generally speaking. They dressed nicely, were better mannered, acted classy, etc... Obviously this isn't true for everyone, but its how society was in general."
5.0,"People who have adopted older children, what were the initial days, months, years like?[SEP]I have not adopted older children but I was an ""older"" adopted child. I was older than 6 and I was adopted with two older biological siblings, one of whom was a teenager. Let me just state to anyone thinking about or in the process of doing this: Just because you chose to be their parent does not mean they have to chose to be your child. They will not bond to you immediately like a biological parent, they will always feel more connected to the idea of a birth parent or an actual birth parent. They might eventually love you more, sure, but they will always wonder and feel a sense of worthlessness or brokenness. ""Why didn't my parents love me enough?"" Also, so many adoptive parents that I have met and heard about that have horrible egos. They think they are a saint and deserve and endless supply of love and gratitude from their child(ren) for choosing to adopt. The child you adopt will never, ever be perfect. They will never be grateful all of the time, and they shouldn't have to be. Again, they didn't chose you. So many parents adopt in order to fulfill their idea of a perfect family. While adopting is a wonderful thing to do and can be so fulfilling, it requires a lot of patience and understanding. And few to no expectations. Children should not have to be grateful that someone chose to provide the bare minimum of what they need to live (shelter, food, education, etc)."
5.0,What's something you really wish you'd have done at your wedding?[SEP]Ate some of the buffet. Apparently it was amazing but I was too busy to try it.
5.0,"First draft to final draft examples?[SEP]Brandon Sanderson, because of course he did, has posted one of his books in all versions from first draft to finished product. Under a creative commons license to boot. [https://web.archive.org/web/20161124101747/http://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/warbreaker-rights-and-downloads/](https://web.archive.org/web/20161124101747/http://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/warbreaker-rights-and-downloads/) You'd think the stories about him being the best guy ever are exaggerated, but no."
2.0,What drew you to this website?[SEP]Got temporarily banned and shadow banned afterwards on 9gag so i needed a replacement source of distraction. Reddit does seem pretty similar.
4.0,"What are some dumb things you did as a child?[SEP]I used to run around in my living room role playing to a story I made myself that I was improving there where also music breaks that were just rip offs of adventure time and Shawn mendes songs, because I did stuff like that I’m very creative and have a bunch of non cringy story ideas, but looking back it’s just awkward"
4.0,"Which is the worst game you’ve ever played?[SEP]I don't remember the absolute worst, but as a kid I had Hydlide on the NES, and I eventually beat it by renting it from the movie store. I only did it because I was saving up for a copy of Final Fantasy, because some monster at the store would intentionally delete every save but his own whenever they rented a game. Like, I would rent Zelda and see a save in slot 1. So I'd leave it alone, start a new save in slot 2 or 3, and then return the game. Next time I'd rent it, his save would be there, but he'd have deleted my save, because fuck me for daring to save on ""his"" cart, I guess. Even after I got my own copies, I'd rent games I knew he'd rent, see if his name was on the save file, and delete his saves, just to be a dick back to him. Fuck you for deleting my save files, Davie. I hope it was just as frustrating for you, you selfish little bastard."
5.0,"What subject should NOT be taught in school?[SEP]In The US at least, Cursive. IIRC the whole purpose of cursive is to make writing faster, and to avoid unsightly ink drips from the quill or fountain pen being used. But some psychologists in Quebec figured that it’s not any faster than standard block print, and I don’t know anyone that evens owns a quill pen. I’m not saying it shouldn’t be an available thing to learn, but why is it still mandatory? My nine year old daughter that types all most as fast as me is required to learn cursive right now. Maybe make it an art elective with calligraphy, let them explore how penmanship can be an art, experiment with different inks and pens. And **MAYBE** instead of forcing third graders to learn an obsolete skill, they could take the time saved and teach them some more critical thinking skills. Das just me tho."
3.0,"Does anyone know of places online to ask Native American/indigenous peoples their opinion on my writing/worldbuilding?[SEP]You may want to check out local band/tribal/nation offices. You could always say that you are writing a story that involves Indigenous lore (or is inspired by it), and you want to make sure you are being respectful and appreciative, and are looking for feedback."
5.0,"is happiness possible if you only have a modest intellect?[SEP]You should really use Gerson et al.'s translation of the *Enneads*. My sense is that you're reading MacKenna's translation, and it is the absolute worst translation you could read. But to answer the question: yes, human happiness depends on the perfection of our soul's intellect (specifically, bringing it in line with the hypostasis Intellect). Plotinus never talks about having a ""modest"" or ""immodest"" intellect, though, and I don't really know where this is coming from. An intellect is something that we have in virtue of having the kind of soul that we do. There is nothing in principle stopping anyone from being/becoming happy. But of course, many people waste their lives, pay attention to things that waste their time, etc. That's why Plotinus spends so much time in VI.1 talking about why it is wrong for souls to pay attention to things that are ""beneath"" them. You'll never find a satisfactory account of happiness and how we attain it in Plotinus, though. You need to read Porphyry's *Launching-Points to the Intelligible* for that, where he lays out the process step-by-step."
3.0,"People who have been shot, what was it like?[SEP]Was excited for my second shot."
2.0,What are some opinions on the uk?[SEP]I love those cunts.
4.0,"What's your biggest F up at work?[SEP]I was working as a Porter (driving cars from one area to another or doing whatever task you’re asked to do) for a dealership, I was pulling a customers truck out of the parking spot and turned the wheel too far, the step bar of the truck ended up on top of the hood of the car next to it as well as ripping the front bumper off, I froze and didn’t know what to do so I turned the truck off and got out asking for help, luckily since it was my first screw up I didn’t have to pay for the $1000 repair work"
3.0,"What is the reason why some people don't have inner speech in their head?[SEP]Alternately, why would we? Why *would* some people have inner speech? Honestly, I don't think it means much either way. Probably comes down to either very complex genetics or some quirk of development. Or both, both is a pretty likely culprit."
3.0,What's the charecter so HATED that it was removed from the show?[SEP]Roseanne Barr. Good riddance. Love the new series without her
5.0,"Why did you have to call 911 the first time?[SEP]Massive anxiety attack, heart rate was 200 bpm(according to my smart watch) thought I was having a heart attack, didn't experience any pain but I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest. I was just a complete mess and trying to ground myself wasn't helping, it took an hour before I called them and that was why, anxiety attacks are usually 15 minutes then I'm fine, but this was a trainwreck."
4.0,"What's the worst accident (or stupidity) you've watched at work?[SEP]One of the reasons I left Tesla, is due to the sheer number of stupid and OSHA violating behaviors that employees would do on a day-to-day basis. Things included: 1. not roping off high voltage areas 2. not using PPE 3. forcing people to operate on freon systems without a EPA 609 certification 4. requiring the use of a forklift and refusing to get The employees a forklift certification 5. people standing on the arms of the forklift 6. failing to clear an area around the forklift while in use 7. Riding on the side of forklift while it's being operated 8. using a gasoline powered forklift in an area not made to vent gasoline exhaust 9. doing demolitions without a license 10. during said demolitions a steel piece fell from what they were taking apart and Hit the completely open breaker box causing a massive electrical short blowing out a couple of breakers 11. employee servicing those breakers without a license 12. allowing the shop to be open and in operation with only a single person and no oversight 13. safety stations obstructed 14. failing to properly recycle chemicals 15. haphazardly stacking batteries with no cover on the posts and very many of them in risk of creating a short contact and therefore an electrical fire 16. no landline in case of emergencies 17. no cameras or any other security equipment and this is just the stuff I can remember off of the top of my head. I had to leave ASAP"
3.0,Has anyone ever surprised their partners at work for lunch like we see in movies? How much common is it?[SEP]How many people meet their partner for lunch? Is this a trope or noteworthy? It’s incredibly common to the point that it’s not at all noteworthy. Obviously depends on what type of job and where you live - I’ve worked in buildings that both people work on different floors. Meeting a partner for lunch is something they nobody notices. It’s not at all like in movies because people do not care what their colleagues do for lunch and mind their own business.
4.0,"What is something that pisses of most people but you don’t seem to mind?[SEP]Being called with wrong pronouns, being misunderstand as a girl, movie don’t have pointless and badly written minority character People have no idea I’m not a girl and my appearance doesn’t even help even I tried. There are no fucking way they will know whoever gender from their face and people don’t have pronouns tag like in social media (even in sns I don’t get mad over such simple issues either) so if they get it wrong just get your shit together and tell them politely. As long as they polite and don’t call you cunt like random aussie at the bar and don’t keep bother calling wrong one after telling them then there are no reason to get pissed with all pronouns shenanigans"
4.0,"What was the most passive-aggressive gift you have ever received?[SEP]My sister in law, not me. Our father in law and his wife came to town to visit once. My SIL has 4 kids close in age and they were all really little at the time. They were running around *in their own home* and FIL's wife was clearly annoyed. They left after a couple days. A few weeks later, SIL got a parenting book in the mail in how to have better behaved kids. Turned out to be from FIL's wife."
4.0,How much free time did you guys have in college?[SEP]Honestly a lot. Even STEM people who say they never have time for anything are probably lying in order to get brownie points.
5.0,"Should new drivers get a $2000 car so if they crash it it's not a big deal or should they get a newer car with a lot of safety features (like a backup camera and blind spot detection) so there's less of a chance of them crashing in the first place?[SEP]Depends on where your budgeting is,where your finances lie, and how much you want to listen to statistics. Budgeting and finances route, you can either go cheap until they can afford to buy a better car for themselves, and if they dent or ding the car, it’s not a big problem. If you get a new car, there is more safety features, better tech, crumple zones, and driver safety features and ergonomics, at the cost of spending more money, and maybe being a bit more stressed if the vehicle is damaged or wrecked. With statistics; there is a couple stipulations... Usually, a high percentage of new/young drivers have a moderate to high risk of getting into a high speed accident, and a high to extreme risk of getting into a minor accident (distracted and fatigued driving is the most commonly known cause), so you take and apply that statistic, to the new driver(s) skillset and safe handling of a vehicle, and make a decision about wether to buy a newer or older vehicle, depending on what their risk factor is at, and how much you are able to spend in those cases. Hope this helps"
2.0,What should you do when you've met someone who has your number and itsvmaking you miserable?[SEP]Say absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing at all ever. It’s the only way to clean break.
5.0,"What piece of history you have that has not seen by the world?[SEP]One of my college majors was history. For my senior thesis, I did a research paper on Abraham Polonsky, a communist film director who was blacklisted and investigated by the FBI. There were a few books about him, but none had bothered to comb through his personal diaries; one historian had even dismissed them as ""indecipherable"". Well, I spent painstaking hours parsing out word after word of this guy's chicken scratch, and I ended up with a rather sad picture of a man who descended into misanthropy and despair, after having expected so much of humanity and seen so little of it come to fruition."
4.0,Which TV show character have you hated the most ever?[SEP]Joffrey was the most hated thing ever until that final season happened.
4.0,"What's your story with a boss who clearly didn't earn their position?[SEP]There was a VP where I was a receptionist who gave me a proposal to format on company letterhead and mail out, did not ask me to read it. Upon formatting I noticed the sentences weren't correct and were fractured, and as I kept reading I saw it looked like it was written by a 10 year old. I had no idea what to do as he was VP and told me to mail it, but this was a multi million dollar proposal for a client that was written in poor english. (I actually thought someone ran it through a translator, it was that bad). I took it to my facility manager who told me SHE usually rewrites it for him before it comes to me, this was literally how the guy wrote. He had a 4 year college degree. This paper would not have passed 8th grade english. My 10 year old nephew literally wrote better sentence structure than he did. the guy paid someone to do college for him."
5.0,"[Marvel/MCU] Not sure if this is the sub to go to but does anyone have any idea how many nanites are in the Mark L and Mark LXXXV suits, or has/would be willing to do the math to figure that out?[SEP]I would do it by taking a guess at the nanite size, Tony Stark's body's surface area, and the average thickness of his suit. Something like this: 0.5mm diameter cubic nanites (which take up a volume of 0.5^(3) = 0.125mm^(3)) . 2m^(2) body area (estimated from 6ft tall at 180lbs) and 2mm thickness ( like a thick coin ). 2m^(2) is 2,000,000mm^(2) and so the volume of the suit would be 4,000,000mm^(3). Divided by the nanite volume (0.125mm^(3)) would result in 32,000,000 nanites. If you halve the nanite diameter then it'll be 8 times as many (since the volume is the diameter^(3)). If you halve the suit thickness then it'll be half as many. Either way the numbers are in the tens to hundreds of millions. If the nanites are as small as a hair's thickness (\~0.1mm), then the number is in the billions."

3.0,"Which Star Wars Character is more iconic: Qui-Gon Jinn or Mace Windu? And Why?[SEP]Mace Windu. Some of his accolades include having a unique force power (Shatter Point), a nice purple lightsaber, is able to control his inner darkness (he's kinda an in-between type but more on the Jedi side) and all around someone not to fuck with. He was able to contend with the Emperor in a duel which not a lot of people can say that they have. He's also the guy responsible for giving Greivous his cough with Force Crush."
4.0,"Can the main cast of characters share personality traits?[SEP]I have had the same issue, and I believe it can work especially if despite having similar personalities they evolve in different ways throughout your story, and end up making different decisions for their own good reasons. They also might have different backstories that change the way they react to some situations. I just write as a hobby so you might want to get other opinions on this, but I hope it helped a little :)"
3.0,"What is the worst thing you've said in a arguement?[SEP]That my ex bf had a tiny penis and couldn't satisfy me. It was true, but mean as fuck."
4.0,"Had a bad exam, how do I get over it?[SEP]My first year in grad school, I got rear ended and had a concussion. Despite being in neuroscience, no one (including me) knew that I should be resting and not doing things like taking freaking exams! I took a stats exam 2 days after my concussion and absolutely bombed it. I got a 50%. Lowest grade in the class. I was terrified I was going to fail the class, not cut out for grad school, etc. I cried and cried, and really did not handle it gracefully (but hey, I’d just gotten a concussion!). However, I eventually decided that I not only would recover from this slaying, I would master stats and get an outstanding grade on the next exam. Well... I did not get an outstanding grade, haha. BUT I worked my butt off with intense determination and performed MUCH better. Throughout all of this, the professors had 0 sympathy and offered 0 help even when I asked for it. So considering all that, I recovered from the bad grade and became better at stats because of it. All of this to say: take the L, and then use it to make yourself more determined and study harder next time. If you use an obstacle as an opportunity or motivation, then it was not a failure! Hold your head high. We all have a bad time with an exam at some point in our lives!"

That’s normal for a teenager, what aren’t you sad about?” A decade later with a suicide attempt, loads of therapy, and antidepressants, I guess you can say it wasn’t a phase."
4.0,"Sleeping Beauty Problem - Is this a new approach?[SEP](Violates rule 5, but I'll answer it anyway) By ""odds"", I think you mean something like ""objective chance"". Odds of X = p(X)/\[1 - p(X)\] (where the function p(.) can refer to propensities, frequencies, credences,, a measure with no meaning, etc), but that's definitely not what you mean. Everybody agrees that the objective chance that the coin lands H is 0.5. The question is: should Beauty's credence on H (after being awakened by the experimenters but \*before\* the experiment is over) match the objective chance of H? The simplest argument for the thirder position comes from Elga's ""Self-locating beliefs and the sleeping beauty problem"", and it goes like this (my words): &gt;Let's modify the problem so that the coin is only tossed on Monday, after Beauty is awakened (which should make no difference to the solution, since the outcome of the coin only matters after Monday.). Now suppose the experimenter tells Beauty that the day is Monday. What should be her credence on H? It should be 1/2 (the experimenter can even toss the coin in front of her, why should her credence diverge from the objective chance?). But consider the propositions H1: Today is Monday and the coin lands Heads, T1: Today is Monday and the coin lands tails, and T2: Today is Tuesday and the coin lands tails. Her credence on H upon learning that the day is Monday should be P(H1|H1 or T1) = P(H1)/\[P(H1) + P(T1)\] = 1/2, so it follows that P(H1) = P(T1). Furthermore, if she was told that the coin landed tails, she should be indifferent between T1 and T2: P(T1|T1 or T2) = P(T2|T1 or T2), so it follows that P(T1) = P(T2). Therefore, P(H1) = P(T1) = P(T2). Since they have to add up to 1, P(H1) = 1/3. The two main responses to this argument are: 1. Her credence on H upon learning that the day is Monday shouldn't be 1/2. (Halfer) 2. There is something weird about conditioning on purely self-locating beliefs such as ""Today is Monday"". Beauty's credence should be 1/2 before and after learning that the day is Monday (double-halfer). How does your response differ from the two above? How would you respond to Elga's argument? &gt;Let’s say the coin is tossed, but she’s only woken up and asked when it come up H. The odds of each toss are 50% H, but her confidence when asked will be 100% H. Again, she knows the rules. If by ""odds"" you mean objective chance, you are correct. &gt;She knows every toss is 50/50 H/T, but can deduce that for every H she is asked about, there is a T she isn’t. All flips were 50/50 H/T before they were tossed, but if she knows the frequency of those flips she is not asked about (because the flipper is using their advantage of knowing the outcome before asking her and can thereby distort her certainty level however they like), she can use the inverse to determine the odds of what she is asked about. The odds of those H flips are offset by the T flips she can assume happened. She doesn't need any complex argument to know that the ""odds"" (objective chance) of H is 0.5. It's always 0.5, it never changes, it's something we assume for the sake of argument. Similarly, her credence on H is 1 in this case because P(H|The experimenters woke me up &amp; the experimenters only wake me up if the coin lands heads) = 1. &gt;Back to the original problem. For the flipper, when the first T comes up, there’s no difference between: &gt; &gt;\* Flipping that T on Sunday and asking her twice (Monday and Tuesday), and &gt; &gt;\* Flipping that T on Sunday, asking her on Monday, and then flipping the coin Monday night as many times necessary (ignoring any H) until another T comes up, and then asking her on Tuesday using the new T. Those intermediate H flips are independent and irrelevant. &gt; &gt;In Case 2, it’s similar to the original 100% H situation earlier. Here, she’s just not being shown those intermediate H! You are right that if the coin lands tails, it makes no difference if the experimenters choose one of these two options. &gt;So that means for every first T, the flipper would be toss on average one H before the second T. But the flipper doesn’t ask her about those, just like the T flips in my first 100% H scenario. Correct. &gt;In fact, in my first example, the flipper could have just tossed an H and left it there, and then woke her up each Monday and asked about the same H every time. There’s no difference in the odds or anyone’s outcome. When you add the intermediate flips, none of the events wind up being dependent on each other (unlike having each T actually cause both T1 and T2), but it doesn’t change anything. Asking twice about each T just skips the unnecessary step of tossing the one expected H before the second T and then asking about that one. If I understood this right, that's also correct, although it's a bit confusing. &gt;Imagine if the flipper did also ask her whenever an intermediate H occurred. It would then be 50/50 H/T from all perspectives. That's the crucial step. You propose a modification of the problem to argue that i) the solution is clearly 1/2 in the modified problem, and ii) it should therefore be also 1/2 in the original problem. But i) and ii) are not obvious at all. Why should her credence on H in the \*first coin\* be 1/2 if the experimenters toss a second independent coin many times, no matter what? Also, why should this be relevant to the original problem? I'm also not sure what your conclusion even is."
5.0,Which is a best book to understand start-ups?[SEP]&gt;By understanding start-ups I mean not any motivational or self-help book but a book which explains all the legal and technical terms. Got it.

4.0,"How can I make a bland character Interesting?[SEP]I’d like to turn your attention to the character Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Data is not unknowledgeable per se, but as an android, he does lack significant knowledge and understanding about human behavior and especially human emotions. He is like humans, but also very dissimilar from them. This creates a dissonance within him that drives him to dedicate whatever time and energy he can spare into understanding what makes humans human, often surprising the actual humans around him with the naked insight he provides concerning the things they do and feel. For much of the series, Data is emotionless, serious, and fairly unknowledgeable; but because of the perspective he offers and the childlike innocence he has, he is one of the most beloved characters in the entire Star Trek franchise. Basically, all characters need motivation and drive to make them interesting"
4.0,"Who is someone outside your immediate family that you will never forget?[SEP]For me it's my history teacher in 9th grade, I already knew that I wanted to work with history but he showed me how much a good teacher can mean to someone so I looked it up and am now on my way to become a teacher. He also helped me indirectly with my terrible social anxiety as I realised that I needed to go out of my comfort zone and become comfortable with talking if I ever wanted a snowball's chance I'm hell to survive as a teacher"

5.0,"ELI5 Why do we get angry when we're hungry?[SEP]Hungry is uncomfortable. It's unstable. You're not in equilibrium - something has to change. You need to change something to get you back into your stable happy place. When anything stops you, or slows you down, from changing the world around you to get what you need to get to your happy place -- the response is anger. You can change this, though. Not everyone gets angry when they're hungry. First, you can train your brain away from hunger meaning something is terribly wrong. Hunger happens, but food is available, and you *can* wait a bit and it's not dangerous to you if you don't eat for a little while. You can tone down the need to a want. Second, you can train your brain away from anger as a knee-jerk response. You can recognize hunger for what it is, and you can be aware of your temporary emotional state and pause a moment before lashing out. Diffusing anger takes time and effort."
5.0,"Is it possible to make a web page infinitely long?[SEP]You can, there is a means of setting up pages for Endless scroll is quite common for image based entertainment sites, such as instagram or pornsites. It's a fairly simple method, that is better described by others and in video so go to YouTube for this, but here is a simple explanation. Person:requests page Server: sends page starting at section 0, the top of the page Person: begins scrolling, reaches half way point of a section Server: sends next section to add to end of page without reloading Person:receives next section and seamlessly scrolls into it where the process will then repeat"

For decades, we were laughed at, ridiculed, even beaten and jailed. NO ONE gave a shit. It is awe inspiring and so moving to me to see how millennials and gen z have taken up the mantel and are so willing to fight for our planet. Honestly, I never ever thought I would live to see it. They are changing the collective narrative. People CARE now. Its amazing. I'm so proud of our young people. They give me hope."
5.0,"How do you deal with a breakup?[SEP]Don’t get hung up about it. It hurts but take that pain and do something positive. Chances are, if you’re depressed and sad, you put too much of yourself in it which means the other did not. Next time learn to focus on yourself (sounds selfish but there is a reason) always working to improve. The more you work on being better the better person will show up. Just don’t let the pain bog you down. If you’re doing anything positive, keep doing it and don’t let the new Bae/ Boo stop you regardless."
5.0,"What is the strangest encounter you’ve ever had in a public bathroom?[SEP]A well dressed older man was using the urinal next to me while I was at work. Usually this is a quiet and private time. Dude asked me how I was doing. I replied with ""I'm doing fine"" while trying to finish as fast as possible, then proceeded to wash my hands. He kept talking and asked me several random questions while I was trying to gtfo as I would get in trouble if I didn't get back to my area fast enough. He continues to talk to me as I walk out of the restroom and asks me my name. I tell him, and am as polite as possible while edging back... he tells me his name and shakes my hand...... he was the multi-ultra millionaire owner of the business I was working at, and his name was plastered on every product that came out of that business. I was glad that I was polite. My coworkers tripped out and asked what I was talking to him about. I always told people the truth. We had an unexpected conversation while I just needed to have a pee."

5.0,"Why are some people likable even when they don’t try to be?[SEP]It's a trait called charisma. Which is how fast you can build rapport with another person. Being charismatic is difficult and requires practice, learning, and constant improvement. Highly charismatic people aren't usually too dumb. But some people will get lucky and pick up charismatic traits unintentionally. These people make friends easily, but their charisma fades if they are not practicing and improving. It's pretty much just being able to quickly observe another person and respond in a manner that they would like most. This consists of emotional control, self awareness, laughing at others' jokes, and making jokes, being friendly without being disingenuous, finding common ground, being inquisitive or helpful at appropriate times, picking interesting topics of conversation, keeping good conversation rythm, and so on. These are all things that you can improve or get worse at depending on the type of person you want to be. Being likable and being someone whom others gravitate towards is a learned artform. Whether you start off at a low level or not, it is as possible to learn and improve as it is to deteriorate and worsen."
4.0,What was the dumbest tiktok challenge you saw?[SEP]The holocaust shit. I don't know if it was technically a challenge or not tho. Either way it was dishonoring millions of people who suffered just for Internet points. Fuck that trend.
5.0,"What are some polite ways of introducing yourself to someone at the gym?[SEP]If you mean like introduce yourself to another dude, to make a friend? Just go up and ask them to spot you or something, use a reason like that for the interaction, then introduce yourself. Over several trips to the gym, seeing them again and again, make small talk. Don't hold them into long conversations. People are at the gym to lift or work out, not to socialize. But over time, bits here and there, you can become friendly. Maybe after a while you are on a friendly basis with them, you greet every time you see each other, you talk shit, etc. At that point, invite them out with your friends to a party or bar or something. Hang out with them outside the gym, build an actual friendship up. If you mean to a lady? Like you are trying to hit on a girl at the gym. Fuck off. Seriously, fuck off. DON'T DO IT. Women go to the gym to work out, not to be hit on by random creeps. If you do this, you are being a creep. Not only that, but also you are going to fuck up that chick's situation. I've talked to multiple lady friends of mine that have had to quit a gym membership and find a new one because of a creepy guy. Don't be that guy. Meet girls in the normal venues. It's 2021, it's literally never been easier to meet girls, use the technology. Or use the normal social venues like clubs or bars or organizations. Don't creep on girls at the gym."

4.0,"Just found my mom doing a blowjob to a stranger that has my same age in the middle of the kitchen 10 minutes ago, what should I do ?[SEP]Here is the rub. Your mom is not a bad person for giving a blow job or having a sexual relationship with a young stranger. I would approach it with this in mind and argue what is within your lane- that she shouldn’t do it when all of y’all could just walk in. It’s inappropriate, especially with the little kids around. It would be inappropriate for you to get pleasured on the countertop- and it is for your mom too. Especially midday with kids home. Any conversation about this guy or her being a mom and she shouldn’t give blowjobs or whatever is a distraction that she could grab and run away with- I can imagine the following conversation: it’s none of your business who or what I do. Could derail the conversation."
5.0,"What is the most angry you have ever been?[SEP]So when I was in grade school I had a bit of an anger issue so every time I got angry I would run off hide under the steps at recess and cry until I calmed down but one time at recess a teacher wouldn't let me go and calm down because they were lecturing me for not letting the bullies at recess take a ball from me by force and my anger and sadness gets worse whenever I am forced to keep talking about what made me sad or angry so throughout the lecture I kept getting more and more agitated and I kept trying to get away so I wouldn't harm anyone if I lost control like what happens whenever I am not allowed to calm down but the teacher still forced me to stay there so eventually I lost control, threw the ball I was holding straight at the ground as hard as possible and ran off to calm down and I got a referral for ""attacking a teacher"" when the ball never even touch her and everyone could easily figure out I was about to lose control the second they saw me and the teacher kept me there until I did so if it did hurt her she 100% deserved it because she was supposed to be a teacher who knew how to help a kid and she couldn't tell I was about to lose control from the look of sheer rage on my face usually whenever I am about to lose control because of anger I get as far away as possible and start biting my hands and arms to stop myself from hurting people, which actually regularly left obvious bite marks on my arm for a half hour or so, I only tried not to hurt people because I try to help not harm because I already get tormented at home to the point that I hide under this to cry without getting punished for basically showing any emotion other than happiness."
4.0,"ELI5: How can my phone delete pictures?[SEP]Your phone is a computer, so let's talk about how computers delete things. When your computer stores data, like a picture, it writes down the information in its storage - this can be a disk, or a solid state drive. But it's not enough to write it down. The computer needs to find the information again later. So the computer has a ""notebook"" at the start of the drive, called the index. In the index, it writes down what information it has, and where it wrote that information down. Now let's say you delete the picture. It would be wasteful to erase all the data. So instead, the computer erases it's entry in the index, so that it knows the spot is available to write something over that data if it needs the space later. This is why you shouldn't throw out hard drives with personal information without wiping them first."

4.0,"If you told your ex that you were scared of them, what do you think would be their reaction?[SEP]He would probably be angry and then try to wreck my house again"
3.0,What would happen if the entire population of a continent disappeared overnight?[SEP]Europeans will want to colonise and steal that land
4.0,"What is the funniest thing you heard a teacher or professor say in class?[SEP]This happened to a friend, but I *have* to share it. There was a very cranky math professor named Dr Z teaching a class on differential equations. He had a habit of filling every square inch of the chalkboard with notes, and would methodically work his way from the left side of the board to the right until he ran out of space, and then walk all the way left and start from the beginning again, like an IBM typewriter. At the start of one class he asked if everyone could see his writing, and one student, let's call him Derek, said ""no"" because a lectern was in the way. Dr Z, delighted that only Derek couldn't see that section of board, scribbled ""Derek is stupid"" right in the blind spot and then continued on as if nothing happened. Dr Z would also give you whatever spare change he had in his pocket if you caught a mistake while he was lecturing—or alternatively, throw his chalk at you if he turned around and caught you on your phone. He was a lifelong vegetarian and would often lecture barefoot or in socks during the winter. He maintains a blog with hundreds upon hundreds of mathematical hot takes, and he's been updating it continuously since the late 90s. I took a couple classes with him, easily one of the strangest people I have ever met (but a great professor nonetheless)"
3.0,"What numbers pop into your head when you hear people say ""a few"", ""a couple"", and ""several""?[SEP]a few=3-5 a couple=2 sometimes 3 several=7-9 SEVeral and SEVen just always click together"
3.0,"Anyone got some stories of people who went from lazy procrastinators to productive people?[SEP]i’ll tell you a few things that have worked out for me. 1) always put pen to the paper while studying material. making handwritten notes makes the studying process way more satisfying. 2) have a glass of water on your study table at all times. Don’t ask me why, just do it. Sip frequently. 3) if you find yourself in a terrible rut of unproductivity (i’m talking about weeks and weeks of minimal input), get a haircut. Straight up. 4) be aware of how you talk to yourself. 5) give nofap/nosurf an attempt and see whether they suit you. 6) if you ever feel unproductive in the morning, make a plan to order pizza or tacos or whatever it is that you like in the evening. This definitely gives you something to look forward to. for obvious reasons, practice this moderately 7) when bored and sulky, just reminisce on your good times or think forward to whatever plans you have with your friends. look forward. gives you a kick of enthusiasm. look man, some of these may sound stupid, but that’s the point. these are really just random things that have helped me get through unproductive ruts. i hope you get it all figured out man. remember to give it time. oh and btw, you’re 20 you have a shit ton of time to do better and heaps of opportunities coming your way. So chill on that"
5.0,"have you ever been in trouble for something you didn’t do? if so what was it for?[SEP]Yes, with out going into too much detail, I was blamed for a mistake at work. I told my boss who messed up, but the guy blamed me. I decided it’d be best for me to just not make it a bigger deal then it should’ve been. I just stopped arguing. I never said I did it, but I took the punishment. Learned I can’t trust some coworkers and that I got to look out for myself."
3.0,What’s gonna backfire some day?[SEP]The toilet water onto my ass cheeks after some fire ass Mexican food
5.0,"What is the full range of options that teens (under 18) could have in terms of jobs?[SEP]Working at coffeeshops, restaurants, retail, and any minimum wage customer service jobs are very easily available for teenagers to start out. However, every customer service job has its ups and downs and sometimes it might me frustrating for teenagers who are also dealing with school. Alternatively, babysitting, house sitting, and pet sitting are also very nice and relaxing jobs that will also allow teenagers time to work on their schoolwork while performing the job since these jobs do not require 100% of the teen’s attention at all times. Lastly, if certain teenagers are interested in specific things, for example mechanics or electronics, you can look into internships and specific companies might be willing to take teenagers as interns and even pay for their education if they are willing to stay within the same profession after high school."
4.0,"What are some of the best books on psychology?[SEP]Not stictly about Psychology itself, but 'Freakonomics' is a really good read about market psychology and influences. I would highly reccomend it."
4.0,"What is a bad habit that you really want to get rid of, but can't get rid of because you have had it for so long?[SEP]Playing bullet chess. It's ruining my game and wasting my time."
4.0,How do you go from a quiet person to a social and talkative person?[SEP]I have a few drinks.
2.0,[Star Wars The Clone Wars] what do the symbols on the back of the armour meen?[SEP]A picture would be a huge help
4.0,"What's the wierdest dream you have had?[SEP]I've had aplenty of weird dreams, so I never thought I'd be dumbfounded by one. Not so, I had a dream where my perspective acted like the cameras in wildlife documentaries while David Attenborough narrated a scene of a pond with a single frog on a branch. David just kept on repeating "" there's a frog in this pond"" over and over"", while the frog just chilled on the branch. When I woke up I was like, "" wtf brain""."
5.0,"ELI5: Why does colours seem so much less vibrant after sleeping in the sun?[SEP]I would guess it has something to do with the pupillary light reflex. The pupil restricts in bright light to allow less light in so it’s easier to see contrast in bright light. Conversely, the pupil opens up in darkness to allow more light in. Additionally, the rods and cones that are what detect the light entering the eye. As the ambient brightness increases,they grow less sensitive and in darkness, they are more sensitive. Simply put, this is because as the light level increases, the rods and cones will send a weaker signal to the brain telling you that they just detected a particle of light. You may notice it takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness when going from a brightly lit area to outside at night. These are evolutionary adaptions that allow humans to see well in varying levels of ambient light."
4.0,"What is the worst thing that could happen if Pokémons were real?[SEP]We have Pokémon that can: Fuck up time space, create tsunamis, earthquakes, blizzards, hurricanes... There's literally a rapist Pokémon"
5.0,"What would you do if your job accidentally paid you a double paycheck?[SEP]I got an extra expense check for a few hundred bucks. I only briefly considered keeping it, but then wondered if it was a “honesty test” as I was due for a promotion to project manager for a large industrial construction company. In that role, I spent $1-3M a month (building water plants is expensive!) with little supervision from upper management as my boss would only come to visit our construction site every 3-6 months. So I reported it to my boss and accounting. I got an attaboi and was soon promoted. I can’t say for sure if it was a simple mistake or a test, but I have always guarded my rep for honesty and trustworthiness. As once you lose people’s trust it’s hard if not impossible to regain. So I do the right thing whether anyone is watching or not. That’s how I live with myself. Lol."
4.0,What are some embarrassing things your parents did in public?[SEP]My mom always argues with cashiers and salesmen even when there is no reason for it. She's the kind of person who gets offended when they're offered a bigger size of clothes. So when we have to go shopping together I have to control her all the time.
3.0,What is the craziest thing your landlord has tried to charge you for upon ending a tenancy?[SEP]Their basement flooded. And somehow a shitty old mattress getting wet was worth my deposit.
2.0,How hard to gain your trust?[SEP]People that try the hardest to gain your trust are usually those that are the least deserving
5.0,"Books similar to Netflix's Castlevania?[SEP]I wish I knew more examples of this too. I recently read Stephen King's *Salem's Lot*, which is kind of a classic vampire story set in modern times. With how popular King is, I'm surprised people don't consider the book more often. It has some great characters, scary moments, and some humor. Ending is a bit, well... it's a King ending, so you know what you're signing up for. But I enjoyed the atmosphere and characters all the same. Great to read at the beginning of the autumn season."
5.0,What individual food item represents each culture?[SEP]Jamaicans - jerk chicken Brits- roast and Yorkshire pudding Us- hot dogs or hamburgers Canadians - poutine
5.0,"In a few sentences, what is a deep philosophical thought that you have?[SEP]Everything is something as long as someone says it is. And somehow we all kind of agree on certain universally accepted somethings just to make our existence make sense."
4.0,"If you had to describe your sense of humour with a movie, which would it be?[SEP]Arthur (1981) Burn After Reading (2008) Midnight Run (1989?) Best In Show (2000) Thank You For Smoking (2005)"
4.0,What’s the best book you’ve ever read?[SEP]The First Law trilogy. You have to be realistic about these things.
4.0,"If you could hire an actor to play one of their characters and hang out with you for an hour who would it be?[SEP]Captain Holt for the win, or Janet from the good place"
3.0,What is the hardest English accent to understand?[SEP]Cockney. I can never figure out what half the words are suppose to be.
3.0,What's was ruined to you only once someone pointed it out?[SEP]That sesame street is about a group of friends operating a meth distribution ring.
5.0,"ELI5: How are higher housing prices and higher car prices not considered price gouging, but raising the price of gas and toilet paper is?[SEP]Price gouging by definition happens only in a crisis, like a natural disaster. It's taking advantage of a *sudden* shortage in a *critical* good. Like if your city's water system blows up, and suddenly somebody starts selling bottled water for $300 a bottle. That's price gouging. Any other changes in price, in any situation that isn't a crisis, or in any good that's not strictly critical, is not price gouging. It's other changes in price resulting from other changes in supply and demand. That's not to say that rising prices are never a problem, as long as they aren't price gouging. They could very well be a problem! They could be a result of rampant inflation like in the 1970s, or of a financial bubble like real estate in 2008, or of a company attaining monopoly power in its industry. Those are all very bad market conditions. But they're not ""price gouging""."
4.0,"What is something from your country that you dislike, but the rest of the world seems to love?[SEP]The beaches, I mean I used to love them, but they're just not fun places to be anymore, you get sand everywhere, you could get burnt from the sun quite easily, sharks and jellyfish exist and I get bored easily."
4.0,"Is historical accuracy not necessary for my fantasy story?[SEP]The whole ""historical accuracy"" thing is a difficult game. One route is to go Tolkien and build a full, self-consistent mythology, but that requires incredible patience and knowledge of history. The other is to go GRRM and model your world on some aspects of real history, do a ridiculously half-hearted job with other aspects of your world, and then sell your book as ""real"" history (to be clear, I like a lot of what Martin does, but [this blog](https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/) gives a great point-by-point analysis of how his portrayal of the Dothraki is lazily researched, historically nonsensical, and sells what are essentially ethnic stereotypes as ""real history""). My point is that you don't need full detail for everything--your world just needs to feel self-consistent. If I'm reading a story, I won't get (too) bothered if a character's job doesn't match the real historical job it was based on, or if the political organization of X culture isn't quite like Y culture it was rooted in, but I will be annoyed if the job is portrayed inconsistently within the story itself, or if X culture behaves in an illogical or implausible way. I will also note that you might run the risk of feeling derivative of real history if you base too much of your worldbuilding on the real one, especially if you're doing a version of a period that people might be familiar with, or has been portrayed similarly in fiction--maybe give Codex Alera a brief read and make sure you haven't duplicated anything by accident, or draw a little more from different cultures and periods. I get the sense that Rome and Medieval Europe are pretty common inspirations for a lot of fantasy stories, or even sci-fi, such as Panem in the Hunger Games; see what you can do to add a new spin, maybe by exploring the social myths surrounding why people love these periods, such as the idealized idea of chivalric culture for the medieval period, or notions of an orderly and invincible empire beset by barbarians that still surround Rome (the blog I mentioned actually does a [breakdown](https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/) of the trope of a decadent empire versus barbarians, which originated in cultural depictions of Rome, that's definitely worth a read)"
3.0,"What is the most thought provoking question ?[SEP]well shit, this one i guess. it forced me to try and think of one and im not satisfied with my answers"
4.0,"To those who NEVER want to have a child, what are your reasons?[SEP]I do not have the financial stability, emotional bandwith, or living space to be a parent. And I honestly am not interested in that responsibility. I have bipolar disorder and ADHD. I have anxiety attacks and impulse control problems. Taking care of ME is overwhelming let alone another human being. And I don't ever want to give a child less than they deserve. I worked with kids. I LOVE kids. But, my disorders started to interfere with my ability to maintain patience and logic and effective problem solving skills. I left working with kids when I realized it was no longer a healthy situation for me or the kids. I would love to go into some form of entertainment for kids to stay connected to them (children are the most interesting people on the planet), but not an authority or care giving role. There are so many people better qualified for that."
5.0,"How can I accept the way I look?[SEP]Doing litttle steps towards improvement helps confidence and your body over time Bad teeth switch to whitening toothpaste, floss, better toothbrush Bad acne, find skin regiment Get a fresh cut and speak with the styliat about a new shampoo and conditioner treatment Etc"
4.0,What is something movies always gets it wrong?[SEP]Nothing besides bulletproof vests can stop a bullet Also infinite ammo. People with guns never have to reload.
5.0,People that work in the food industry what's the one thing people should never order at your establishment?[SEP]Mussels. This one is tough because I love mussels but ordering mussels at a restaurant is dicey at best. Mussels need to be fresh. Like out of the ocean that morning fresh. They often end up hanging out recycling their own water for way too long. The no fish on Mondays thing is over blown but I trust Tony on this one. When you want mussels cook em yourself.
4.0,"What is the freakiest time you have been alone and something supernatural or scary happened?[SEP]Not my story, so I can't vouch for the validity of it, but someone told me about a story that happened at their student dorm back in university. She was alone in her room with nothing particular to do, and her eye happened to fall on the door handle. The handle was moving downwards, *very* slowly, as if someone was trying to open the door quietly to sneak into her room. She didn't hear any footsteps in the hall, implying that whoever it was must have been sneaking. She did not have a roommate (having roommates in university dorms isn't really a thing in my country, student accommodations are usually rooms for one person here). When the handle was almost completely turned, she suddenly got up from her chair and loudly banged on the door and locked it. She never did find out who it was."
4.0,What is your favorite childhood tv show/film that gives a nostalgic feel??[SEP]The Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy or Courage the Cowardly Dog
4.0,"What would it take for you to write a short poem ?[SEP]For a poem that’s funny, A little bit of money. For one that’s deep, I’ll need a good night’s sleep. For one that touches your soul, I’ll need some sort of miracle. But if you want one with a rhyme, I don’t know how to do that."
5.0,"Precautions before sending a book idea to an illustrator?[SEP]I sincerely doubt he'll steal your concept. If this illustrator is a professional (which it sounds like), this is a work for hire gig and is all about money. Speaking from my limited experience as a book cover illustrator, I suppose expect to pay for it, please don't argue the rates, if he doesn't offer a contract or invoice, ask for one for your records, if you have a particular vision for what you want, be upfront and say that--and if you have images to illustrate, excellent--do NOT wait until halfway through the project to be like, ""that isn't what I had in mind, do it again."" Oh, and if this illustrator is a professional, don't expect the answer will be an automatic yes right off. He might have a full client list right now. If he says no, just ask if he knows anyone else who would be interested and is looking for work."
5.0,"have you had sleep paralysis? What did you feel and see then?[SEP]Yes many times. Usually it's just me being half awake and paralyzed. I usually panic, try moving my feet and biting my tongue. Once I was asleep in the living room and sleep paralyzed and saw someone break into my house, bust the door open and walk towards me. It wasn't real but it did shock me fully awake. And another time there was something dark, seemed like a demon, standing right over me whispering in my ear. I don't remember what it said. Freaked out and woke up. But mostly just stuck. It super sucks."
4.0,"Many of us envy those who have big friend groups. People with a big friend group, how lavish is it actually?[SEP]I don't know if mine counts as big or not id say there's about 20 of us. If you count the people we talk to online then probably 30. So if that's big then I'd say what happens is you have the small little groups where everyone is close then the big group of everyone where we all know enough about each other to be friends. I'd say its good as you can drift between the small groups and there's lots more people do things with. Plus every now and then you get a deeper relationship with one of the members and learn more about them which is really nice. So I'm saying its good although I will admit there are little bits of bitching but its more in the way of I don't like this about this person but I like enough about them to be friends maybe I can help them improve upon the thing that I dislike about them as long as its something they want to change. That's the type of thing it is to me."
3.0,"If you had to name/rename a color, what would you name it, and why?[SEP]I would rename the color orange to whatever that fruit is called"
2.0,"Zero to Hero - You tried to change someone from a zero to a hero. Why did you think you had the right and/or the authority to change another person? This is a question of autonomy, and human value. What did you learn about yourself?[SEP]What does helping someone out have anything to do with autonomy?"
4.0,"What's a line in movie/show/anime that has stuck with you since you first heard it?[SEP]Watch me L. I will right equations with one hand, and right names with the other. I will get a potato chip, AND EAT IT!"
2.0,"You, a “Karen”, find yourself in the Middle Ages. What are you demanding to speak to the manager about?[SEP]My coupon that I insist on using even though it was made it something called the 1970's?"
4.0,"People who likes to travel solo, what's the best thing about it?[SEP]Guess whatever I can think of boils down to not having to think about other peoples expectations. I'm fine sleeping in a shitty motel or taking off when I randomly wake up bored at 4 AM or doing something completely different than I originally set out to do. Don't want to constantly check in with whoever's travelling with me to make sure they're fine with any of that. Keeps things simple, and I like that."
4.0,"ELI5:Is infinity of numbers from 0 to 1 as big as the infinity off all numbers?[SEP]Yes. And no. It depends what you mean by ""as big as."" Infinity is infinite, so talking about its size is a bit complicated. A mathematician called Georg Cantor did a lot of work in this area, and came up with the idea of ""countable"" and ""uncountable"" infinities. A countable infinity is one which you can count. Sure, you'll never get to the end (because it is infinite), but you can keep listing them. The positive whole numbers are the basic example of countable infinity - you can start counting at 1 and after an infinite amount of time you'll have got all the numbers. An uncountable infinity is one that you can't count. You can't put them all in a numbered list; there are too many of them. ""Real"" numbers are uncountable. There are an uncountably infinite number of numbers between 1 and 2, if we're allowed to use real numbers. There is no way to list them. Set theory (which Cantor developed) has a whole series of symbols to represent the ""size"" (or ""cardinality"") of infinite sets, called [aleph numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_numbers). Aleph-nought or aleph-zero (א followed by a subscript 0, I can't figure out how to type that in my browser) represents the size of the set of positive whole numbers, and then there is an aleph-one, aleph-two and various other numbers. Except these don't work like normal numbers."
4.0,"How fast is Ruby Rose?[SEP]If you're talking about the food fight, I believe it was the mass of Team JNPR and the debris hitting the wall to crack it, not Ruby. It'd be a lot of work to figure out the numbers for that situation given the variety of objects, unknown weight of JNPR and the speed, but as a rough benchmark I'd say 770mph (the sound barrier) is plausible for that feat. AFAIK Ruby is a bullet-timer. Most combatants in Remnant are able to dodge bullet fire, and Ruby is definitely highlighted for her speed. Her Semblance allows her to break down her (and people/objects she holds onto) physical form into (IIRC) massless matter, allowing for brief omni-directional travel at blistering speeds. Her only limit seems to be the strain it puts on her, meaning that while she can zip around the battlefield or carry her group through the Atlas Command Centre no issue, she can't be using it for extended periods of time to travel across the world or anything like it. It's possible that in her ""rose petal form"" she can't breathe (like Mirio Togata), making sense given the complexities of massless matter not being able to respirate until reforming. Its why she's able to use it effortlessly during most fights, but couldn't just Semblance her way up Beacon Tower from the base to confront Cinder ASAP. So TLDR speed somewhere between 770mph and 1800mph (Avg bullet speed, though bullet timing also depends on distance, path of the bullet and knowing to dodge, etc)."
4.0,"Whats is the difference between a dictatorship of the proletariat and a left-wing state dictatorship?[SEP]Direct quote from the communist manifesto by Marx: “When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms, and of classes generally, **and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.**”"
4.0,ELI5: Why do modern windmills have only 3 blades?[SEP]What do you define as efficiency? If efficiency is the percentage of available energy that you can get from the moving air then more but and thinner blades are more efficient. Aerodynamic efficiency increases with number of blades but with diminishing return. 1-&gt;2 blades is 6% more efficient 2-3 blades is a additional 3%. The move from 3-&gt;4 will add less. There are [one bladed wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_design#/media/File:Mod-0_Wind_turbine.jpg) So you need to build more blades so increase cost. You also need to decrease the width of the blades so all blades will cost more for the same strength. The result is if efficiency is the power of the wind turbine vs the cost of the wind turbine the 2-3 blade is optimal because the cost of more blades increase more then the extra power you get out. So build adding more wind turbines for the same cost is more efficent. So for normal wind power parks more blades are not better.

5.0,"People in Entertainment, what's the best TV show/pilot/script that never made it to air?[SEP]I worked on a prank show (2003 or 2004) that had two guys go on a date. For every moment of intimacy (touching, holding hands, kissing, etc) they got more money. The kicker was both guys were straight. They ended up kissing, more of a peck, but hilarious because the whole thing was awkward. I was a production assistant and never saw a final cut, but I heard both guys were pissed. That was only one prank but the show never got picked up."
3.0,"What is a good job that pays well straight out of high school?[SEP]Prostitution, if you’re in an area where it’s legal"
2.0,What keeps YOU in this world?[SEP]I want to see the evolution of technology and future video games. Things like advanced VR and various other things to make these fantasy worlds more immersive.
3.0,"Landlords, what's the strangest thing your tenants have called you for?[SEP]They called me screaming that the roof was caving in. I had a fucking panic attack called the fire department the whole deal. Turns out it was winter and the gutter had ice in it and some water leaked ON THE PORCH. Literally they were screaming that the roof was caving in, I thought they were trapped inside in danger it really wasn’t funny, or ok for them to do that. They had a lot of issues and were living and trashing my house for literally no profit, it was the one time I was a “landlord” and literally the last time"
3.0,"ELI5 Why can't we colonize the moon??[SEP]Colonization means setting up a sustainable colony. That means growing all the food and managing all the water they need. With our present technology that's impossible on either the Moon or Mars. People talk about going to Mars, because going to the moon has been done."
3.0,What was the moment you realise you were in a toxic relationship?[SEP]The moment I realized I felt trapped.
3.0,"What was the worst food crime you’ve seen commuted?[SEP]Mayo on fries..well, anything really, but especially fries."
4.0,"Of the movies you’ve seen which one did you dislike the first time, but now really love?[SEP]Just because this has been a recent personal journey of mine to get back into the franchise: The Rise of Skywalker. Absolutely despised it at first for a wide number of reasons, but after taking steps to cut out toxicity and reevaluate my expectations, I actually enjoy it quite a bit. Not my favorite, but I can sit down with some popcorn and have a good time with it now."
5.0,"What do you call that thing that you see when you put some pressure on your eyes, and you see colors and stuff ?[SEP]These shapes and colours, called ‘phosphenes’, were reported as long ago as the time of the ancient Greeks. Rubbing your eyes increases the pressure within the eyeball and this pressure activates ganglion cells in the retina in the same way as light does. Your brain doesn’t know the difference and so interprets the activation as though you were seeing light from the world outside"
4.0,What is the best compliment someone can give YOU?[SEP]Any variation of them saying they like spending time with me
3.0,"If you found out you were going to be an improbable statistic, but didn't know which one, what circumstances or actions will you be avoiding?[SEP]I would not walk under coconut trees"

3.0,How common is a ball massage?[SEP]My uncle used to give me them all the time
4.0,"How did you accidentally break the law in a foreign country?[SEP]One time I think I entered Europe illegally. I had to go to Germany on a business trip. The airline I was on was on strike with only partial flights. I ended up getting routed through US-&gt;Luxembourg-&gt;Paris-&gt;Frankfurt. By the time I landed I was so exhausted I must have walked through some wrong gates because I didn't go through customs/border security and get a visa stamped in my passport. I only realized this when leaving and getting the exit stamp, I got grilled by security about how I got in and why I don't have an entry stamp."
4.0,What was your favourite hobby as a kid?[SEP]Downhill MTB. Age 8-20.
4.0,"Those of you who are not American, what was your opinion on American candy if you ever had it?[SEP]Too sweet. Too big. Too much sugar."
2.0,What is the most incredibly relevent movie you could watch right now? Is it Jaws?[SEP]Genuinely curious as to why it would be Jaws?
4.0,"Eli5: Why do ships leave calm paths in the ocean?[SEP]Waves are water that's travelling on top of the rest of the water. They don't just form, they are created by something pushing the water (usually wind). So when a ship goes through water, it pushes the waves to the side (due to the shape of the hull being designed to cut through the water) or just flattens the water, leaving a calmer patch behind it. Unless there is really strong wind, once a ship has travelled over a section of water, it'll remain flat until either wind creates new waves or waves from outside the calm zone move into it, which usually takes a while as the wake from the ship (the turbulent water) acts as a barrier."
4.0,"What dream made you think , ""damn my mind is super creative with stupid shit"" ?[SEP]Was in an apocalypse scenario similar to fallout but there are lots of zombies. The thing that stuck out the most was me getting cornered in a big open building about to presumably get eaten alive. Then I just hear yelling and I see Will Smith sprinting at full speed yelling, “I’m fucking Will Smith!” That got the attention of all the zombies on him and chased him throughout. They were sprinting zombies but Will Smith was outrunning them."
5.0,"College students/Graduates, what is something about college that no one told you about when first starting out that you wish you knew?[SEP]The first two years are a breeze. The last two years, major courses, grad project/capstone course are difficult and meant to be that way. Make sure you know **HOW TO LEARN** the most effective way before your junior year, as the one information they feed you increases in both volume and conceptual difficulty. It essentially takes longer to learn concepts and they throw more of them at you to learn. The days of cramming the night before might work for a semester or two, but **YOU WILL GET BURNED OUT** if you continue unhealthy study habits."
4.0,What are some topics that a wise person should avoid arguing about?[SEP]The key word is arguing. A wise person discusses and doesn’t argue.
5.0,"What are your craziest office drama stories?[SEP]I was hired through a temp agency to do data entry at a fledgling communications company. It was a typical office with multiple desks in each room. It was not the type of business customers physically came into. As soon as I started I began getting those “women in competition” vibes from the boss man’s assistant. We all worked in the same room (boss man included), but she delegated all the work and was who we would go to with any questions/issues we might have. A few days into my employment the assistant informed me I was in violation of the dress code. I was wearing one of those flowered one piece rompers that were so popular in the early 90’s. Although the hem hit right above my knee, no cleavage showed, it wasn’t tight fitting, etc., it did have spaghetti straps. I was given two options - stay in the outfit and receive a write up or go home and change on my lunch hour. As I was young and did not question authority at the time, I simply complied. I got back to the office, out of breath and famished, with one minute of my lunch hour to spare. Boss man happened to be sitting at his desk when I walked in to the data entry room. He looked at me quizzically and asked if I had been wearing something different when he saw me earlier. I explained the dress code thing and stressed I really didn’t want a disciplinary action in my file, especially so soon after starting. He burst out in laughter and said, “You females are something else! We don’t have a goddamn dress code!”"
3.0,"If you could have a public place all to yourself, where and why?[SEP]Historical sites typically overrun by sweaty tourists, just for a little while, to enjoy in peace."
5.0,"[Netflix Castlevania] Is there a chance that any random forgemaster could have resurrected Dracula 'by accident' while they were making night-creatures?[SEP]as far as i'm aware of the lore of Castlevania, there is no ""random forgemasters"", Hector and Isaac are the only 2 that currently exist, and if the lore from the video game Castlevania: Curse of Darkness (in which ""forgemasters"" were first introduced, and which stars the characters of Hector and Isaac) is in any way canon as it relates to the animated series, forgemasters don't really just pull any random soul when they are working their magic, they seem to at least have some idea of the exact power of the soul that they are working with or attempting to pull from hell, and Dracula has a particularly powerful soul. I would imagine trying to pull Dracula's soul out of hell would feel to them like they caught a whale shark on their fishing line instead of a bass. I'm not even sure a forgemaster *could* work with Dracula's soul, or that they would know it was Dracula's soul specifically, but they would be able to sense that it was a very powerful soul, probably too powerful to attempt using"
3.0,Is anyone else looking forward to being old?[SEP]I want to be back in the the scene of “aww but he can’t help it”. You get free passes when you’re a kid. I want to be old and drunk stumbling around the zoo without any real fear of being arrested
4.0,"If Marty from back to the future got his mom pregnant what would have happen ?[SEP]The whole back to the future timeliness is filled with paradoxes. If he did any of the things he did in that film he would probably either cause a alternative universe, therefore not changing the original timeline, or he would create a paradox and end the universe."
5.0,"Are long sentences inherently bad, or what?[SEP]Long sentences aren't inherently bad, but I believe what they're cautioning you about is *how* you're using them. Long sentences make the reader slow down, short sentences speed reading up. There is a concept in writing about this: Parataxis and Hypotaxis. The latter being constructs, while the former are sentence ""snippets"" strung together. As an example, Hypotaxis usage when describing the environment and its impact on the character are a good way of settling the reader in the moment by slowing them down while reading, however when used in action scenes it calms the situation down--even if in the story there's explosions everywhere. For action scenes, parataxis would imo be better, as the shorter sentences allow you to give your writing a beat, and with that give it this action feel when reading it."

5.0,"Eli5 What is the difference between a contusion (bruise) and an ecchymosis?[SEP]They are not quite interchangeable. Ecchymosis is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath, usually from a bruise but not always. Specifically it refers to the skin discoloration not the underlying cause. A contusion is when an injured blood vessel or capillaries leak blood into the surrounding tissue. This is the underlying condition, not the surface appearance. So you see ecchymosis to diagnose a contusion, but they are not the same thing."
5.0,"How would I go about redoing my bachelors?[SEP]Look for post-baccalaureate programs. You don't need to re-do an entire degree or do an entirely new undergrad. Pick a school that allows you to only take the courses that are required for the BA/BS in the new field you want to study, then only do those courses. Trust me, the more recent your good GPA and distant your old GPA will make a huge difference. Also, make sure to network with possible mentors to get onto undergrad research projects--these contacts will help you get into a graduate program and the newer, better GPA will be weighted much more than an older, worse GPA. When applying to graduate schools, your letter on intent can include 1-2 sentences about the low GPA (you don't have to go into specifics) and how you have turned things around and done super awesome since then by applying yourself and learning from past missteps. One other suggestion--try to take a few graduate courses while still doing undergrad (there may be some split courses--where both grad and undergrad students are split-listed in the class). This will prove that you can succeed in graduate-level courses. I did a post-baccalaureate in a STEM field, followed my own advice above and didn't even finish the post-bacc before getting admitted to the masters program in the same department. Most post-baccs take 12-24 months, but depends on how many core/prereq classes you need for the new degree. You graduate admission will weight the most recent GPA, but you will have to provide all college/university degrees in the application. Most state colleges and universities will enroll you as a ""Second BA/BS"" and others may refer to you as a post-bacc. I preferred referring to myself as a post-bacc. I spent 2 years taking more math, more chem and physics, on top of the major required courses. Then transitioned to the master's, taking graduate courses that transferred into my master's in the last half of my second year. All courses were FAFSA funded until the university/program started fully funding me with teaching and research assistantships that covered all enrollment costs and paid me a stipend."
5.0,"What was the most beutiful country/place where you have ever been, why?[SEP]The hike from Garmisch, Germany, through the Partnach gorge, up to the summit of the Zugspiz. It is the tallest mountain in Germany, and straddles the border with Austria. There are amazing views throughout the entire hike. But nothing tops the view at the summit. You can see over 400 peaks in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. Half way up, along the hiking trail, there is a hostel with a great restaurant. It sits right along the Partnach River, and if you stay the night, they wake you up for breakfast by playing the biggest glockenspiel I have ever seen. It had to be all of 25' tall!"

When meeting someone new i always analyze the person i'm interacting with to find about their merits and flaws so i can present it to them to talk about it and work them out so i can ""help"" them improve, but i've realized that i can't apply my thoughts so bluntly on other people, some people may not see what i see as a flaw and get offended while some could see me as an arrogant person who just believe to know better , when in reality i just want to help. I should think about myself more, and help just if needed, i'm not entitled to help someone who doesn't even ask."

4.0,"Eli5 How do cellphones connect to each other?[SEP]Well, for a start, the communication between the phone and the cell tower is the only point where you need to keep the signals separate--the communication between the towers is using high-bandwidth links that can easily carry a massive volume of calls. Since each tower is only likely to be handling a few thousand phones (since there are a \*lot\* of towers) and not all of those phones will simultaneously be making calls, they don't need anywhere near as much bandwidth. It \*is\* possible for cell towers to get overwhelmed if a lot of people do call at the same time, though, which happens often in major emergency situations. For this reason the cellphone company will prioritise what data goes through the cell tower. Emergency calls take precedence over other voice calls, which in turn take precedence over data, which is why you'll often still be able to make a call even if your phone is unable to connect to the Internet."
3.0,What is something you’ve never told anyone because they never asked?[SEP]How my day is going Why I seem upset What I did over the weekend Why I'm in a bad mood
5.0,"How to carry school stuff easier in-between classes?[SEP]aw man. It sucks that you’re not allowed to carry even a bag! Maybe try stacking. Place all your books, laptop, etc on top of eachother and hug that to your chest w/ water bottle/pencil case in between. Also maybe you could find a clip on attachment for your water bottle? You could attach it to your belt/pants, and thats one less thing to carry. Final suggestion is finding a band of some sort to tie around your books/schoolwork/etc. (look up extra large rubber bands on google and you’ll see what i mean, [for example something like this! ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077ZFK8SZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_SZCA1AMVVYKPQ4FX10S0) ) These can bind ur books together and they’ll be easier to carry, since they’re less likely to go everywhere if u were to accidentally drop them. They’ll stick together + u can get on with ur day! Hope i was able to be of some help, or at least spark some ideas :)"

4.0,"People who have gotten over irrational insecurities about dancing. Fucking how?[SEP]I used to be like this. The key is to figure out what kind of judgement you'd like to avoid; the specifics help decide how to get over it. I couldn't dance in front of people and I realized it's because they knew me and could remember it -- so I tried dancing in the middle of a packed, somewhat dark room full of strangers where no one can see you (cause you're lost in the crowd, hiding in plain sight) and no one remembers because you're a stranger like everyone else. I did this a bunch of times and then I'd slowly add a few familiar faces in the crowd but not a lot. By that time I'd be used to dancing around people and it made it easy to forget there were some familiar folk. Gradually I got used to it all and got over it. However, if your trouble is people seeing you *at all* (which may partially be why you were more comfortable with your wife), then try getting your closest friends (or family) over, just a few to begin with, and try dancing. Keeping a dark room always helps for me because I just feel less conscious, but you can set it up the way you want. People who you don't have much to lose with because you're already pretty comfortable with them. If drinking or anything else helps you loosen up, have a bit, but not too much. You want to make it easier but you also want to experience and successfully overcome your difficulty in a replicable way. You can repeat this a bunch of times, gradually adding people or mixing up your environment to get used to it. Take it as slow as you'd like. The main thing to remember is that regardless of all this: even the best dancers don't always want to dance, so if at some point you feel insecure about dancing, you don't have to dance! Don't feel forced. You're supposed to do what you enjoy, and sometimes you may not be in the mood but that doesn't reflect poorly on you. And more importantly, you're not dancing for others -- you're dancing for you! This isn't a competition, and your personal goal isn't to be technically proficient. If the goal is to have a good time (which it is), then you just need to move the way you feel good. If you were trying serious dance moves but not feeling the music and just doing them mechanically, that'd be a shame. Just dance without thinking too much about how your body's moving, and remember that at the end of it all, at least you got a good time out of it. As a backup, in any case, it may be handy to just pick up some super easy movements (perhaps look up beginner dance moves on youtube) that you can revert to if you find yourself becoming conscious again, and then simply allow yourself to feel the music and transition back to moving naturally, however that may be. It gets easier, and it's *for* *you*. I know it's easier said than done -- but don't get in your head about this, just stay in your body. I'm sure you'll have a great time."
5.0,"What’s a small act of kindness you were once shown, that you’ll never forget?[SEP]Too many to list, but here are a couple gems. A kind old woman ran up to me to return money that had fallen out of my pocket, saying her son is about my age. This taught me to treat certain strangers like my own family. My friend gave me a dry set of clothes after I tried and failed to rescue someone from drowning. This pulled me out of a dark state of mind and reminded me of the goodness in the world. Sometimes just knowing about the goodness of this world gives us more power to contribute to it."

There would be like, 5 and then another would pop in, maybe about 8 or 9 in total. We watched them for about an hour, moving from far in the distance over our heads and far away in the opposite direction. It was bizarre. Who would be flying a net of drones at 3 AM on a weekday over a suburb in South Carolina? It was the strangest thing"

5.0,"Question: How to get started with philosophy?[SEP]Hey there! It seems to me like it would help if we split this into **three possible scenarios:** being interested in philosophy as a whole, being interested in a specific topic, or being interested in a specific author. **Scenario 1:** If you're interested in philosophy as a whole, but you have no idea where to start, you can look over the different sub-topics of philosophy and see what you find interesting based on the sorts of questions it asks. Here are some (very) broad examples: Ethical/moral philosophy tries to answer questions like: *""What is moral, or good?""*, *""Where does morality come from?""*, and *""Is morality objective or subjective/relative?""*. Metaphysics tries to answer questions like: *""What exists?""*, *""What is this stuff that exists like?"",* *""Why does anything exist at all?""*, and *""Could things have been different? Could nothing have existed at all?""* Aesthetics, which deals with beauty, art, etc., pursues questions like: *""What makes something beautiful?""*, *""What is beauty?""*, *""How do we decide what does or doesn't count as art?""*, and more. If this approach doesn't seem like your style, maybe watch a [philosophy video series on Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/7o6pm0/what_are_some_good_philosophy_youtube_channels/), or listen to [a philosophy podcast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i0faz/what_are_some_good_philosophy_podcasts/) A lot of them cover philosophy from start to finish (that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea) in a very approachable and understandable way. **Scenario 2:** If you're interested in a specific topic of philosophy, consider reading the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) article on that topic or reading a fundamentals/introduction type book on it. For example, I once took a class on the philosophy of mind, and I still have this book called *~~The Fundamentals of Ethics~~* ~~by Russ Schafer-Landau~~ (edit: I meant to say *Philosophy of Mind: A Contemporary Introduction* by John Heil) that I think is a great summary of the different theories of mind, and the arguments for and against them. **Scenario 3:** If you have a particular philosopher in mind that you want to get into, you can look into whatever books they've written that most appeal to you. Nietzsche, for example, has *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, which is a novel. In a completely different style, he also has *Beyond Good and Evil*, which takes the form of many (relatively) short aphorisms, sort of like a list of bullet points. Pick what works for you based on the style and topic, or just look up what most people start with for that philosopher. Best of luck! Edit: Improved formatting. Edit 2: Added links to r/AskPhilosophyFAQ posts about Youtube channels and podcasts about philosophy. --- P.S. I have no formal education in philosophy, aside from a few classes and whatever I've read and done on my own. I'm just some dude who likes philosophy. If anything I said was wrong or misleading, others should feel free to correct me."

5.0,"What is your favorite concept album?[SEP]King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard has a few worth checking out: *Nonagon Infinity,* the endlessly looping album the opens the door into their weird mythology, *Paper Mache Dream Baloon* which is a pleasant poppy acoustic romp with lyrics that sound like they were lifted from the journal of a serial killer, and *Eyes Like the Sky* which is a kind of Western spoken word story over some raw ass 'Morriconne on mescaline' kinda sound."
5.0,"ELI5 - why are hydrogen cars not more prominent?[SEP]Hydrogen is a complete joke for a few reasons: - A fuel cell powertrain costs around $30k - Refilling a hydrogen car costs about $80 (to go 350 miles) - Refueling stations are only located in cities and special corridors. (Coast to coast drives STILL need a refueling truck) There's some stuff about fitting tanks in the car, storing hydrogen at fuel stations, and efficiency - but that's basically solved or no big deal. The big problems are all are economic - but for passenger cars EVs are superior and cheaper. (They have a hope at catching the heavy trucking industry, but it's not looking good - and asking CA and the USA for R&amp;D grants or infrastructure - like they have been doing for the last 20 years - isn't gonna cut it.) People who claim it is a green fuel are swallowing oil company propaganda (most H is generated as a byproduct of petrochemical production) or banking on a miracle process from academia (people write papers about algae or some bs) that's never gonna scale. This largely hasn't changed in the last 10 years, too. Nobody is serious about hydrogen, it was all just ""pretend to be green but push gas cars"" hoping someone would gut the regulations before the industry has to retool for electric. Figures per googling - please correct me if I've overlooked something."
5.0,"What was your weirdest experience with a substitute teacher?[SEP]There an ancient dude who walked into my class and got really mad at us when we wouldn’t get out our math textbooks. We would have, but it wasn’t a math class. It was a history class. A few minutes later, the principal walked in and was like, “Mr. So-and-So, you’re supposed to be at this other school down the road. How did you get in here?” I’ve had him other times for other classes also. One was for an actual math class. He sat in a chair for the entire class looking in a notebook (it looked blank?) and occasionally writing a word or two. He wouldn’t give us our assignments to do. He just looked in his notebook all class. My teacher was really mad when she came back and assumed we didn’t do it on our own, but then she realized that *no one* did the work. Not even the kids who took the class seriously. The work was in the same area on her desk that she left with the same paperclip in the same spot."
4.0,"How much harder are STEM majors compared to other majors?[SEP]They're ""harder"" in the sense that they require more contact time than humanities and will require more practical skills like labwork. So in terms of time spent in lectures and time spent studying, it will be more work. But it's all a matter of skillset and fit. If you're interested in it, it isn't too hard. I've done BSc, MRes, and a PhD in a STEM setting (Neuroscience) and I reckon I found it easier than I would Geography or History for example, just because I'm far more interested in it. I never really know what to say when people are like ""oh you must be really smart"" or shit like that, cos to me, it's no different than being an expert in any other field. It's just got a reputation that I don't think is 100% deserved. If you're truly interested in one of them then pick a STEM subject, they do tend to lead to higher earnings. If you aren't really interested though, it *will* seem incredibly difficult. You need at least a little passion for the subject to motivate you to do the work or it will be a chore. Play to your strengths and interests. In the end, it would be better to get a 1st class degree in literature or art than it would be to get a 3rd in STEM."
5.0,"Eli5 - How do companies make money when we waste our time on their apps/websites?[SEP]Everyone else has hit the central issue, so I'll cover some side issues as well. The facebook app, software, and website are pretty much malware, except you clicked a user agreement making what they are doing legal. Its the same for most other social media platforms as well. Facebook doesn't just track the information you post when you are actively using their site. They track your browsing, streaming, and device activity as much as they can. All of this is used to develop a massive database of information they can use to sell a product to advertisers. Their business isn't providing a platform for you to speak and keep in touch, they are in the business of selling advertising opportunities to other businesses. Google does the same thing. Don't give apps on your phone permissions they don't seem to need, but require anyways. Yeah, you may not be able to use the app, but think about what the app can do with that permission. If you tell an app it can access your microphone, you have given it permission to access the microphone. At all times (some phones allow you to limit it to when the app is in use only, but who knows what the phone classifies as in-use). And keep in mind a lot of in-app setting don't have to be performing what they say they are. Just cause you clicked a button that said ""don't track me"" doesn't mean that button actually did anything."
5.0,"Does this make me sound like a r/niceguy?[SEP]i dont think you messed up. It's actually kinda nice that you thought about your feelings and honestly presented them to her. However, i feel like she might need some time to think things through especially with her date going bad and and you confessing, dont worry tho, you didnt do anything wrong or anything that will result in you losing her. Its nice that you care ab her but if she asks for space then make sure to give it to her. I hope things work out, all the best op!"
4.0,"What are the bounds of self-overcoming in power relationships?[SEP]I think you are posing some excellent questions. By which I mean, you are posing questions that indicate a high level of interpretive engagement with the text. Since there is so much going on here, and because my preference is to make brief comments, I'm going to focus on just one of the questions you raise here - the first one (the main one?) regarding ""is it self-overcoming to deny one's own will to enact themselves if it in turn means holding to a higher principle they've established for themselves (etc)."" Of course, I understand this question as an elucidation of the concerns articulated in your entire second paragraph. What strikes me about this tenor of questioning is that it seems to take the Nietzschean will (or ""self,"" or ""soul"") to be something that could be (""in principle"" as it were) definitively established. As if we could know what it meant to ""enact the will."" Then, once the domain of the will has been definitively established, we can contrast it usefully with whatever concerns do not reside within the domain of the will (let's say, concern relating to some extraneous moral law or ideology) and introduce the worry that we aren't acting within the proper domain like good Nietzscheans. Probably you already have a sense of how this way of conceptualizing matters is problematic. The will is \_not\_, to begin with, a unified, given thing with an identifiable goal that we can seek to actualize. If only it were this would obviate all the difficult work that Nietzsche thinks we have ahead of us. A silly analogy. I'm reading an interesting book when it dawns on me that I'm getting hungry. And in that moment I find myself with two irreconcilable drives: a drive to continue reading and a drive to put the book down and make something to eat. It seems clear that, at least temporarily, one of these drives is going to have to be subsumed to the other. Perhaps the answer lies in one drive brutishly overpowering the other ""in the heat of the moment."" Perhaps the answer lies in appealing to a ""higher"" drive (a drive for ""reason,"" say) to adjudicate the matter on behalf of both. So, to extend the analogy I suspect that at least some of your questions could be more usefully conceptualized as attempts to reconcile conflicting aspects of the will, rather than as the pitting of the will (as if it were something already unified) against something else. Self-overcoming is precisely this process of continuous re-integration of conflicting drives. It is substantively *introspective* work that is not related that much to the external environment or whatever except insofar as that environment place us in certain circumstances. Re-read the preface to On the Genealogy of Morals. Nietzsche talks a lot there about the importance of striving for a kind of structural integrity (which straightforwardly suggests that this integrity does not really exist in the self except as an ideal we strive toward). Lastly, I will try to anticipate a possible criticism. It may sound like I'm saying ""hey there is nothing wrong with being an unreflective consumer/capitalist - that's just one aspect of your will LOL."" But the essential thing here for proper self-overcoming is that there is a (legit) striving for unity going on. If there is no striving for unity, no attempt to adjudicate conflicts in the light of some higher purpose, if it's just one drive overpowering another in a way that is left to happenstance then there is no self-overcoming going on. There is, in fact, scarcely a self worth acknowledging in such a picture."
4.0,"ELI5: Do plants have unique DNA like humans? For example, if there were two gardenia bushes and a flower fell to the ground, could it be determined which one it came from like genetic testing etc on humans?[SEP]You have a unique set of DNA from other humans and the same concept applies to plants even of the same subspecies. However, there are exceptions to this with plants. Consider this: If you had a skin graft taken to regrow your ear, your DNA would match a sample taken from that graft as you are its original source. Unless you had another graft taken, no other skin graft would contain your DNA, even if they appear very similar. The same applies to plant ""cuttings"", the original plants all have slightly different DNA but the cuttings themselves would have the same DNA as their ""host"" plants or parent plants. It's almost a form of cloning, the DNA (cutting X) is identical to that of the original source (plant X) but a cutting (cutting Y) from another plant (plant Y) of the same subspecies would have slightly different DNA than cutting X or plant X. So, yes and no, it depends (as seen above)"

But really, people who are depressed tend to hide it, so there isn't much to identificate them."
4.0,"ELI5 how the krebs cycle works?[SEP]Whenever you eat food, the digestive system breaks down larger, complex molecules (polymers) into smaller, simpler molecules (monomers). There are three main categories of food polymers: fats, proteins, and carbs. Fats are broken down into fatty acids, proteins are broken down into amino acids, and carbs are broken down into simpler sugars like glucose. Any time you break chemical bonds, you release some energy. In this case, breaking chemical bonds in food releases energy in the form of high-energy electrons. The body wants to harness some of this energy by storing it as a high-energy chemical bond in ATP. Electrons flow from high energy to low energy, like a stream flowing downhill. In the same way that a waterwheel or water turbine can harness some of the energy of water flowing downhill, the enzyme ATP synthase can harness some of the energy of electrons flowing downhill (by transforming it into rotational kinetic energy). This process allows the conversion of ADP to ATP, providing the cell with energy. One way to make this process more efficient is to add many intermediate steps. Instead of water flowing down a hill, imagine water flowing down a staircase, with a small waterwheel at each step. This setup allows more energy to be harvested than if there were just one large waterwheel on a straight-line hill. The acids in the citric acid cycle are like the steps on this staircase. They minimize energy loss by breaking the flow of energy into many smaller steps. As another way to think about it, burning energy from food is a controlled combustion reaction. We can harness more energy by burning the fuel in many small, controlled, slow steps instead of just burning it all at once as a giant explosion. As a summary of the actual chemistry, the electrons released by breaking chemical bonds in food flow in this order: food polymer --&gt; food monomer --&gt; pyruvic acid (from carbs or protein) or fatty acid (from fat) --&gt; acetyl coenzyme A --&gt; citric acid cycle --&gt; NADH --&gt; electron transport chain --&gt; ATP. To expand this summary, electrons in the citric acid cycle flow like: citric acid --&gt; isocitric acid --&gt; alpha-ketoglutaric acid --&gt; succinyl-coenzyme A --&gt; succinic acid --&gt; fumaric acid --&gt; malic acid --&gt; oxaloacetic acid --&gt; citric acid. I doubt that you will need to know all of these steps unless you're really into biochemistry. The important thing is just that electrons are flowing downhill from food to ATP by passing through many chemical intermediates. This is a slow, controlled burning of energy. Some additional details: the bottom of the hill in this metaphor is an oxygen molecule. Electrons flow into part of an oxygen molecule, which then rapidly combines with hydrogen in the cell to form water. Also, some steps of the citric acid cycle form carbon dioxide, since the carbon atoms in food are rearranged when food molecules are broken down into simpler substances. This is why the chemical equation for cellular respiration is basically: food + oxygen --&gt; water + carbon dioxide + energy."

4.0,"What jobs are usually split between the bitchiest workers and the nicest workers?[SEP]Vet receptionists! I had to call a vet clinic today, and before I could even finish my question about if they do a very specific task, the fucking receptionist interrupted me and told me ""no"". I was taken aback by how sudden and simple her response was that I stuttered and said ""no as in you don't do that.. or no as in no walk ins?"", and she just responded with ""no, none of it. Now if that's all your questions, have a nice day"" and hung up on me. On the flip side of that coin, I've called our other local vet and had a very pleasant and light hearted conversation with their receptionist, so it's definitely a gamble on what you're going to get, and usually (from what I've learned) if the receptionist is snarky and bitchy like that, then its a pretty good guess that the other staff members are just like them."
4.0,"Is it still normal to take friends on holiday?[SEP]it's totally normal to invite friends to go camping, even into adulthood. as for your dad's gf... that should 100% be his call and not yours. you may be surprised and find it to be a much better experience than you expect and maybe actually bond with her a bit."
4.0,"ELI5 How is money ""pumped"" into the economy to cause inflation?[SEP]The more of something there is the less valuable it is. It's basically supply and demand, but I suspect that your question is more asking about the principals of supply and demand. Salt in some ancient cultures was used as a currency because it was rare in bulk form and had a lot of practical use. That can work as a currency so long as the general amount of salt stays consistent within the economy. If too many people eat the salt, then that means there is less salt in the economy. If I were to want to obtain a pound of salt, it would be harder to do than before simply because there is less of it. The people who have the salt will catch on to this and trade with you but at a higher price than before. This is deflation. Where it gets interesting is that some people may decline trading their salt because they'd prefer to hold on to it and trade it at a higher value, which in effect decreases the supply of salt in the economy which drives up the price even more. If George comes across a giant salt deposit, he'll trade it with others. As the salt disperses into the economy, people will have less need/want for it because they will be able to obtain it much easier, and so they'll stop asking as much for it. A big part of this is that people who have too much will be bidding down others. The trade value of the salt goes down. Where it gets interesting is that the people who trade that new currency first get the most benefit from it. George was making trades before the prices adjusted, while others are paying an inflated price with no benefit to them. People who were stockpiling on salt because they thought it'd only go up in value have now become a lot richer. To really hammer the point, I really like sour patch kids. If someone wants to trade me 1 bag for a 50 cents, I'll do it. 2 for $1, yes. 5 for $2.50, maybe, but maybe $2.25. 30 for $15.00, I mean it is a good deal, but I really don't need that many, maybe for 10.00. 100 for $50.00, I mean I really like them, maybe for $25.00 but I don't know what I'd do with them and trying to sell them at a markup to someone else would be annoying so no thanks. The above is a poorly illustrated example of how increase supply can affect price. From a distance, price comes down to supply and demand. The more of something is the less valuable it will be, and vice versa. Demand is similar, you can have something that is of very low supply but nobody may want it, like jars of pickled beetle penises. Monetary economics can use this relationship by simply printing more money. Money is abstract, unlike gold, and can be created. This will eventually cause prices to increase as there is a greater supply. This can also increase spending in general, because if someone expects the value of their dollar to go down, it makes sense to spend it while it is more valuable. A point can be made that there are some currencies that are better than others. There's a story of some colony that used tobacco as a currency. It worked out alright until they figured out how to make tons of tobacco and people lost all their savings. There is only so much tobacco that can be useful. Some things like gold are generally more stable because you can't easily make more of it and its hard to destroy. It's still susceptible to inflation though, like if you stumble across a giant gold deposit. Fiat currency is a double edged sword, if you manage it well it can be fine, but as shown by a lot of countries it is easy to mess up and cause hyperinflation."
4.0,"I'm in a well-paying political telemarketing job that actively helps Trump Republicans and spreads misinformation which makes me sick but I need the money as a current university student. Is it possible to feel better about what I'm doing?[SEP]Skew the data. Just joking. Do your job as you are paid to do. Maybe in the fall, work for a democratic caucus and give them all this secret information that you collected with your photographic memory. Ignore that also. JK. Maybe keep on applying for other jobs. Then give your two weeks notice when you secure another job."

4.0,"Why are you not proud of your children?[SEP]I was the child. My Dad was not proud of me because...... * I wasn't the first to get married (my sister was, he even tried to get her to postpone until I get a wedding date. I wasn't even seeing anyone at that point) * I wasn't the first to give him grandchildren (he has 6 from his other children and I still don't have any) * I didn't start college at 18 (I started at 27, completed my Bachelor's) * I left the country to teach English in Asia * I don't have an Asian girlfriend (he claims that native Asian women are easy) * I preferred to be asked out by women * I don't hit women (According to him, real men hit women) * Preferred career women over submissive housewives (I refuse to get together with a potential housewife)"

4.0,"If concrete had the same nutritional value, taste, and texture as American marshmallows, how fast would your neighborhood’s sidewalk disappear?[SEP]One good rainstorm and it would wash away. With that much air trapped inside it, erosion would be massively accelerated, further increased by the weight and pressure of various things moving and resting on it. The sidewalk would flatten out and turn into a sandy mush flowing down the street."
4.0,What is the most literal guilty pleasure you have indulged in?[SEP]Correcting poor grammar- can't get more literal!
4.0,"ELI5: How can a country create jobs to improve its economy?[SEP]The number of jobs supplied in an economy is a function of the size of aggregate effective demand. That is, businesses will employ people based on how much stuff they expect to sell, and how many people they need to sell that stuff. So if you want more jobs, you need higher effective demand. Or, you need to reduce the number of hours one person could do a job. If everyone was limited to 20 working hours a week for example, there would be a lot more jobs."

4.0,"What are the limits of reason and rationality according to Albert Camus?[SEP]I always understood existentialist, or absurdist, references to the limits of reason or even their general discussion of the irrational aspects of human nature, to be part of a longer historical response to the critical analysis of reason by earlier modern philosophers. I think the most significant examples of this are in Kant's Critique and in Humean epistemology. Connecting the dots from early modern philosophy to Camus are historical trends like German Romanticism, early existentialist Russian literature, Kierkegaard's writing, etc."
4.0,"If you could give students video games for homework, what would you give them and what would it teach them?[SEP]This is kinda happening in my school now (im a student), our teacher let us play journey in class, it was to analyse it. What was the meaning of the game, how did the music effect you and how you played. The teacher also let us play nidhogg vs eachother, that was alot of fun. I asked him about which type of games he was allowd to let us play, the asnwer, anything as long as he can come up with a reason to play. AKA what did the game want to teach you. It’s inglish class as well, our next task is to simply talk to him, have a conversation either about how games effect society in USA, a movie that tells about society in the USA, or a song that brings up something about society in the USA.

4.0,Which random compliment that someone gave a long time ago you still remember for some reason?[SEP]My hair used to be really long and curly and as a guy it was hard to maintain for me. So on most days it used to be really messy. One day in high school this girl i really liked just walked up to me and said my hair looked really nice. l used to be really insecure abt my looks so hearing that from my crush and even thinking abt it now really makes me smile.

5.0,"How do i tell my father that always believed in me that i got 4/15 in my math test?[SEP]Ask him for help. It doesn't mean he's going to be standing over your shoulder helping you study. He might suggest getting extra help from your school/teacher/tutor. It might mean the two of you can sit down together and evaluate your study habits, find where there may be a problem that can, when it's addressed, be solved. The key here is help. You're not asking him to do it for you, so this means that you'll have to give it your all to see things through. It also means checking in honestly and saying whether that is helping or if you're having problems still that may need further tweaking. But my advice before you approach him is to take a beat and try to figure out where you went off track. Can you uncover the reasons you wound up getting a poor grade? Were you not studying? Not understanding? Did you ask for help then? Are you staying healthy and balanced? Getting enough sleep, exercise, eating ""brain food""? By showing you are invested in identifying your downfalls and acknowledging those areas need to change, you increase your chances of a positive interaction with your dad. And you'll feel better about yourself, too. Don't expect your dad to be instantly happy about your mature approach. Disappointment takes us all a few minutes to move past. Just stay still and let it pass. He is, after all, on your side."

I would spray my chest, which was extremely hairy, with axe or something similar and light it up. It would burn for a second or two and go out without hurting. I would do it at parties when people would ask and didn’t mind obliging their request. Fun times. My wife just shakes her head when me or my buddies talk about it!"
5.0,"eli5 Why hasn’t the price of video games been inflated like every other product?[SEP]With the rise of digital distribution the expenses in delivering games has dropped, and many games have added costs in the form of optional things you can pay extra money for. As such, there's a bit of a standard expectation for new games to sell around $60. The first game that tries to redefine that standard at, say, $80, is a game that sells less than the ones it's competing against."
5.0,"ELI5: Why do gear shifters on automatics go from Park to Reverse first? Why not Neutral or straight into Drive?[SEP]You could probably add a N between P and R in newer cars that are all electronic but in older cars (back when the PRND standard was adopted) it was a mechanical linkage with the transmission and there could be only one N. So that means it would be PNRD or PNDR. PNRD is problematic from a safety standpoint because if your accelerator gets stuck while in D you want to be able to instantly shift to N so your engine may rev like hell but at least you won't be powering the drive wheels anymore. Likewise with PNDR if the same thing happened while backing up. (unlikely, but possible). So the best compromise is PRND so whether you are in R or D you can go to N instantly and disengage the engine from the drivetrain."

4.0,"Skinny ladies, how did you gain weight and curves??[SEP]i suggest to eat more of your basal metabolic rate, expecially fruits and carbohydrate (rice is the best one). doing sport could help not gain too much fats. swiming is the most complete sport and it trains pecs ( bigger breasts that don’t fall out)"
4.0,"eli5: What’s a “liquidation event” in Crypto?[SEP]Basically there are crypto trading platforms where you can lend the service provider's money to ""boost"" your buying power. For example if I would use 10x leverage on $5 I would suddenly have $50 to trade with. So if the price does go in your favour you will be making more than you would have had without leverage, but theres also a risk to lose a lot more. In case the leveraged trade indeed goes south then there's a liquidation price that comes in. When I leveraged my $5 to $50 and the markets turn, causing me to go -$5 I would instantly get liquidated. The platform instantly closes your position when you dont have the money to back up your leverage and I would lose my $5 aswell. Crypto markets took a big dump today, causing leverage traders to get liquidated and thus causing a liquidation event."
4.0,"[Back to the future] What if Delorean DMC-12 was used in place where humanity calendar isn't present?[SEP]The time circuits aren't linked in to some objective universal calendar. It's an interface that allows the driver to understand the process. The actual time-travel mechanism seems to have more to do with ""distance in time from where you are"", and most likely ""counts"" in Planck-time, or iterations thereof. IOW, the ""this is where you are"" setting was determined by Doc simply setting the clock, same as you set any other clock."
4.0,"What did you do to be labeled as ""the crazy neighbor""?[SEP]Not having curtains and sleeping naked while the Neighbors door is facing my Window."
4.0,Are my friends purposely avoiding me?[SEP]Every friend I make eventually does this to me. I had friends for 20 years the day I stopped randomly stopping by their houses was the end of our 20 year friendship. They never invited me to anything. They were always doing stuff together. They'd post on Facebook all the fun they were having. It sucks I know the feeling. It's happening again with the only friend I have left. I'll ask her to do something she'll ignore my message until the day of the plans are nearly over then open it and never reply. I can't say if your friends are purposely doing it. Or why people treat people this way. I never have gotten an explanation they are just there one day and gone the next. It sucks and I feel for you. The only advice I can give you is point blank ask them one day what is going on and hope that they care enough to be honest with you. I regret not asking my friends that but it's been about 10 years now so it may be to late for me. But it's not you.
5.0,"What is the worst book/movie/show you've ever read/watched and why?[SEP]I read a lot so here’s some of my least favorite books: The Merciless by Danelle Vega: It’s a YA horror novel so I probably should have expected much. It had a content warning in it, which is what really drew me to it because I had only seen that once before. It was super boring and did not justify that warning. The twist is at the end ruins the whole book. It leaves a ton of random things unexplained. I know plenty of good books so that so you can speculate but here it just feels like the author just forgot. The Phantom of Manhattan by Fredrick Forsyth: It’s a sequel of The Phantom of the Opera musical. The plot moves really slowly for most of the book than crams a ton of stuff in the last 50 pages. The plot is pretty ridiculous and it ruins most of the characters development from the musical. The also fridge Christine, which I really didn’t appreciate. Breaking Dawn by Stephanie Meyer: Yeah I know, I really shouldn’t have expected much. I found the rest to be entertaining though. It’s both the strangest and most boring thing I’ve ever read. It’s the longest book in the series but somehow almost nothing happens. They spent the whole series building up these bad guys. Several hundred pages are dedicated to preparing for the final battle. And then.... nothing happens. Everyone just goes home. That’s the end of the series."
4.0,"Eli5: why does milk help when you eat something spicy?[SEP]The molecule that's causing the spiciness is called *capsaicin*. Capsaicin triggers nerves that sense heat, causing them to fire even though the food isn't hot (or at least, not as hot as your nerves *think* it is). As long as the capsaicin is on your tongue, it will continue working its way to your nerves and turning them on, keeping that burning sensation going. Capsaicin is **not** water soluble, meaning it doesn't dissolve in water. Capsaicin is [hydrophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3jA40arq9Y), like oil and fat. So, trying to wash the capsaicin away with water does very little: it sticks to the fats in your tongue and around your nerves *way* more than it sticks to water, so the water can't carry it off of your tongue. Without getting to why, things that are water soluble tend not to dissolve in oil, and vice versa. That means that capcaisin *is* pretty soluble in fat and oil. Milk is *full* of fats. Those fats aren't *dissolved* in the water, they're just broken up into such tiny particles that are all mixed together and suspended in the water. Capsaicin, being soluble in fat, will stick to those tiny particles of milk fat and subsequently get carried away by the milk. With the capsaicin removed from your tongue, the nerves start to calm down and stop firing as much. It helps that milk is generally *cold* which your brain thinks is soothing on what your brain thinks is a bad burn. Cold water doesn't help because, as stated before, it doesn't also remove the ""burning."""
5.0,"What is your most desperate situation you have ever been in?[SEP]I'd somehow not noticed that an extra 9 pages of my uni exam existed and spent the entirety of the time just doing my best to solve two questions. Once I realized it was too late. It counted for almost 50 percent of our final grade and I got down on my knees and begged to my professor to let me sit the exam again. I was incredibly embarrassed, anxious, and desperate. Never making that same mistake again."
5.0,"ELI5: How do sailboats sail if the wind isn’t directly behind them? How about if the wind is coming from the front or perpendicular? Do they just sit there and wait?[SEP]Sailboats have a [skinny and very deep keel](https://www.bestboatreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.jpg). It's like a board that goes down from the centre. The result is the boat can easily move forward/back in the direction it's pointing, but very hard to move sideways in the water. You can also pivot the sail. You can turn it to catch the wind, which puts a diagomal push on the boat. But it can \~only move forwards, so it just goes forwards. Can you ice skate? This is a super close process. You don't push straight back to to forwards. You push back and to the side, so there's a diagonal force on your gliding leg. The skate can slide easily in the forwards/back direction, but greatly resists slipping sideways. So upon getting that diagonal push it just slides forward, the easier direction of travel. Yes, the more the wind is from behind, the more efficiently you can use it to sail (the greater % of the wind's speed your boat will go). But you can make use of any wind direction to sail any direction with at least *some* speed. The hardest case is if you want to go directly against the wind. The process to do this is called tacking. Basically you can't sail straight into the wind, but you can go diagonally against it up to a certain angle. So you [zig-zag towards your upwind destination.](https://safe-skipper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/37.1_Tacking.jpg)"

4.0,"There is a sound on guitar that is made when a finger is lightly pressed on all strings. It can be heard on Shawn Mendes’ “There’s nothing holding me back” unplugged version. At 1:13 to 1:14. What is it called?[SEP]I don't know that song, but I think you're describing is what is called a natural harmonic. It occurs when a string or strings just touches the actual fret. It takes a light touch. Typically sounds are made when the fingers press strings down between frets."

5.0,"What was your “Pay It Forward” situation from a stranger?[SEP]My father and I were wandering around lost in Osaka, japan's main train station. We had no idea how to get from there to our hotel, what train to take.. and a foreigner guy who lived in the city saw us, came over, and offered to help figure it all out for us. Said he was helped in much the same way when he first came to live in the country and wanted to offer the same kind of help. He checked maps, even made a phone call to our hotel to locate it, and then sent us on our way to the subway station below for our connecting ride. Really awesome guy :) We still got on the wrong line though. We needed to go to the city center and instead found ourselves taking a long - and very scenic! - train around the city's edge with lots of festivals and other events happening along the way. After 30min we were convinced we were on the wrong train, boarded a train in the opposite direction, and eventually found our hotel thanks to a taxi."
5.0,"What are you doing with software that was designed for doing something else entirely?[SEP]Not me, but my Dad's line of work (in every freaking company he worked for) filled out a form in *Excel* when they were finished with a job. These could have been made in Word or Adobe or something. No. You type the info in cells... Not in a format to run data or create spreadsheets. Just filling out forms in the blank column spaces. They're also put together by either someone who has no clue what they're doing, or knows exactly what they're doing and is the biggest asshole ever. I copied the ""template"" and reformatted it, so the columns weren't all over the place accommodating different sized fonts and long lines of text so everything overlapped. It was atrocious. My Dad was terrible with technology, and those fucking reports did NOT help. If you wanted a tab-like format in a book to keep them in per project, fine I guess. No. One fucking sheet."

5.0,"Would Thanos have won if Loki didn't take the Tesseract?[SEP]Let's think about it. Thanos doesn't attack the Asgardian refugee ship, and instead pokes around in the ruins of Asgard itself until he finds the Tesseract. Thor was going somewhere with his people... probably Earth? Let's assume he was headed for Norway before Thanos attacked. Let's also assume that the Tesseract is the last thing on his mind at the moment, but he'll think about it six months from now or something and figure he should probably check on it. He tells Thanos that it's destroyed along with Asgard, so maybe he wouldn't bother. But at least for now, Thor and Friends head back to Earth. Thanos digs around until he finds the Space Stone. Then he sends his minions to Earth. They grab Dr Strange with zero warning. However things on that end won't play out too differently. Peter Parker is still going to see a giant space ship and go to investigate. Instead of getting some warning and knowing Thanos is coming, Tony Stark will likewise see a giant alien space ship and will choose to investigate. Bruce's warning to everyone basically gave them about half an hour to think about what was happening and come to terms with it. So Tony, Peter, and Dr Strange will all end up on Ebony Maw's ship together, just as they did originally. Bruce will probably be hanging out in Norway with Thor, so he's not calling Steve Rogers. Potentially Wong could do that, but we don't know if he'd think about it. Thanos' minions will attack Scarlet Witch and Vision as normal. I think Cap and his crew were still relatively close by when that attack happened. Quinjets fly fast, but not cross the world in minutes fast. I think it would have been faster for them to call Wanda on the phone and say ""hey we think bad guys are looking for Vision"" than to fly there. So they were probably close by anyway. A giant ship over Edinburgh attracts attention. so I don't think the warning call they got from Bruce necessarily changed events there. Cap and friends drive away Thanos' minions, as they did originally. Thanos gets the Reality Stone from the Collector as normal. He still needs to meet Gamora and uncover the location of the Soul Stone though. Now that I think about it, I think he knew the GotG were close by, and he knew Thor would probably survive to tell them about him. Thanos was expecting them at Knowhere, which is why the illusion with the Collector was already in place when they arrived. It's a simple change in plans to go meet the Guardians somewhere else. I think mostly everything is going to play out as it did in the actual film. And now that I've thought it through fully, it doesn't really matter. Thanos still ""wins"", and the only thing that is important is that Tony remains alive to invent time travel. Assuming the snap goes the same way it did originally, as long as Tony and Ant-Man are still alive, that's all you *really* need."
5.0,"How do you become more disagreeable and authentic?[SEP]If I understand correctly, you want to be more confrontational when you disagree with people. First off, you have the dilemma of what kind of issues warrant being disagreeable: should you go off every time a retail worker doesn't give you the service you want? When someone is forcing you to do something against your moral beliefs? Where do you draw the line? Also, there are ways you can be authentic and disagree with something without being an asshole. You don't need to throw a tantrum at someone because you disagree with what they say-- just state your opinion in a firm and respectful matter. Think about when and how you want to be disagreeable. Clarify, in your mind, if YOU really think that your behavior is acceptable. If you do, then it will be much easier to not care what other people think. &amp;#x200B; Personally, I would quickly lose respect for someone who rages about trivial things. I'm not sure that this is what you mean by being disagreeable-- perhaps you just mean you want to be more firm and not be a pushover. If the latter, I think that's a noble cause. Also, here's something you can disagree with: You don't deserve \*anything\*."
4.0,What is a weird fact that no one really thinks about?[SEP]Concept of souls and reincarnation. The has to be a point where a new soul is born. Or how do you explain huge population growth? Do souls travel in time for that? Than if to compare our live as a game server isnt there’s have to be max players number not because of scarce resourses or living space but because of number of all souls. Another one is cemeteries - its like expanding pieces of locked land that we can’t use.
4.0,"People with major allergies, what's something you wish others could understand?[SEP]That simply popping an antihistamine isn’t going to fix the problem."
4.0,What is the most embarrassing thing that a family member has done while in a foreign country?[SEP]My cousin from Massachusetts spent the majority of his trip to the Dominican Republic drunkenly asking everyone if they knew David Ortiz.
4.0,How did you decide on your current career? And are you enjoying it?[SEP]Economy crashed in 08 and I needed to adjust. Chose based on availability in my area and what I could easily add on to my previous education in a short amount of time. (if I was single I’d have moved but I’m not the breadwinner and had kids well Established in schools etc). Do I like it? It has pros and cons and I get a paycheck every 2 weeks and benefits. No I don’t love it primarily because of the hours and long commute (13 miles but 45 minutes). We all have to work. And what you do needs to serve it’s purpose. This particular job does that at this time. If I didn’t have so much vacation built up and if they were less flexible about how I use it I’d be gone in a minute. My particular dept is very flexible-not a big deal if I’m late and can use vacation in a whim provided others are not already taking off. For me flexibility over rules more money etc.
4.0,"What's an episode of a TV show that was hard to get through? Was it boring, emotional, cringe, etc?[SEP]Skipping the Nina episode and getting straight to the battle with Scar is customary for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood rewatchers. Once is probably enough. Emotional fits well enough."
3.0,Which tv show has THE best episode ever?[SEP]Malcolm in the middle when Hal starts roller skating
5.0,"What would you tell yourself from 10 years ago?[SEP]First off, swear by Dogecoin and gamestop stocks in 2020/2021. Second, never overreact, it will cause you unforgettable shame and issues in the future if you do not speak with patience and think carefully before attending to anything."
4.0,Why don't we see matter manipulators creating vibranium or adamantium?[SEP]These metals are very powerful for specific conditions but they behave in very weird ways. Using those will require very specific knowledge. For example if you were to build a shield out of adamantium then it will be really bad because atleast a steel shield can get dented and absorbing some impact while it will get passed completely to the person holding it. Vibranium is very good for a lot of thing but you can't just use it to build regular things because it will not work out well. To use these metals you need to study their property (and probably need to touch/study the metal before you can create it). You can easily find info about other metals easily but these are not easy to find and it is very hard to figure out what kind of things can be built using them without having a large quantity to use.
5.0,"What's your close call story?[SEP]Kalaloch Beach, Washington, USA. I got there, jumped out of my car, and hopped out on the drift logs. I wanted to get to the sand on the other side of the logs. I jumped from log to log quite a ways when suddenly I heard, then saw a huge wave lifting up the front, huge logs and tossing them around like toothpicks. That wave was going to reach me. I'll never forget the dull, heavy thudding of those logs crashing against one another. I turned and RAN back towards my car hearing the thudding getti g closer and closer. The water came under me and got deeper and deeper. I reached a place where I would have to put my foot down in the sand between logs because the leap was too far to be a safe jump. I was afraid I would slip and fall between the logs and I was afraid to put my foot into the gap because it had lots of water in it. So I crouched down on the log I was on as it heaved upward and sure enough it oh so gently surged against the next log wuth a terrifying clunk. Had I stepped there my leg would have been crushed and I would have been pinned there. I will never, ever again just run out onto a beach without studying the water action first."
4.0,What do you think about making your own wine?[SEP]It’s very easy to make wine. It’s very hard to make good wine.
3.0,"Without naming it, what is the something your state is famous for?[SEP]The only state named after a person."
3.0,"first apartment: what are the must haves to stay organized and have a cozy feel to a 1 bedroom apartment?[SEP]For cozy think texture. A few throw pillows, nice throw blanket or two and a mixture of pictures and canvases on the walls. Try not to keep lots of stuff everywhere, utilize baskets (more texture) under the coffee table for magazines/mail/paper. If you want cozy - avoid glass."
3.0,What Is Your Most Useless Skill?[SEP]I can purr. Like a very large house cat.
2.0,"How would you react and what would you do if a ""Zombie apocalypse"" started right now when you are reading this?[SEP]nice try, FBI man."
4.0,"What's your favorite game and why?[SEP]Halo, because it’s awesome. Arma, because realism."
4.0,"When was the last time you sang when you were alone?[SEP]The last time I can remember is yesterday, though I might have done it absent-mindedly since then. I decided to listen to the Symphony No. 9, ""From the New World"" by Antonín Dvořák in my car, and walked out the door humming the opening bars of the symphony. However, I realized as I was halfway down the driveway that I had left the CD in the house. I was thinking of it enough to hum the melody, but not enough to pick it up as I went out the door."
4.0,"What are important stock facts to know?[SEP]Diversify - some stocks, some bonds. The older you are, the more bonds you should have. Don't put a lot of $ into the place you work - if they go under, you lose a job and your investment When the stock market is low, buy buy buy. Everything is on sale. Don't wait for it to recover then buy. Short term investments are taxed higher, so make sure if you're selling something within a year, that the profit you made isn't lost to taxes."
2.0,Are you on Earth2 and if so when do you think phase 2 will launch?[SEP]I’m on earth 5. I’m four parallel universes ahead of you.
3.0,"What is one thing you were so excited to buy, but then actually was so disappointing?[SEP]Remember the VideoNow? I'd have to say that. Dumb kid me thought I'd be able to watch any show anywhere at any time. When I actually got it, it just had these disks that held two episodes in black-and-white with visual quality like it was shot with a Game Boy Camera. Funny how I'd get exactly what I *thought* the VideoNow would be exactly ten years later when I got my first iPhone."
3.0,What is the best tv series to binge watch?[SEP]The Originals is pretty good during some story arcs. Good for date nights
5.0,"ELI5: Why do data interfaces that are serial (e.g. PCI Express or HDMI) have so many pins on the physical connector? If data is not being sent in parallel, shouldn't you only need one pin each for send and receive, one for ground, and maybe a fourth for clock?[SEP]I can't speak to HDMI, but PCIe I know. The simple answer is the analog of water passing in a pipe. Just as the water in a pipe goes 1 part of water (cross-section area) in series at a time if you watched closely. The simple difference of x16 vs. x1 is that you have a pipe with 16x the diameter vs. ""1x"" or ""normal"" diameter. Similar to how a fire hydrant is a very wide pipe, but a bathroom sink is a narrow pipe. Pipes allow water to flow in a straight line, with varying widths. Why is this useful? Some PCIe uses are for graphics cards that need that x16 diameter pipe to display your mind-blowing videos. Some use cases are just a slow wifi adapter that can use x2 or x4 because the pipe requirements don't need as much ""water"" or ""information"" all at once. Getting deeper, PCIe was invented for flexible use cases that were unforeseen at creation. They allowed a way for future uses to continue with the same interface for ease of computer design re-use (i.e. processor design re-use). Yes, it is a ""serial interface"" - but it's actually complex and using all those pins in parallel too. It's actually a configurable set of ""serial interfaces"" in ""parallel configuration"". If you need to know the details of a serial interface, it simply means that the data contains the clock embedded in the data signal itself. There is a ""PCIe Clock"" signal, but that isn't for data collection, just coordination at the low-level and proper reference alignment to ensure the 2x processors that are talking to each other know what is going on. The details are scary, so just reply if you must know. A real system has Processor &lt;-&gt; PCIe &lt;-&gt; Graphics Card (w/ Processor) &lt;-&gt; HDMI &lt;-&gt; Monitor Another example is Processor &lt;-&gt; PCIe &lt;-&gt; Wi-Fi Client (w/ Processor) &lt; - - air - - &gt; Wi-Fi Access Point (w/ Processor) &lt;-&gt; Cable/Fiber/ (puke) DSL"
1.0,You’re with the girl you love when suddenly a sword is shoved through her chest by your bestfriend as he laughs saying “I hope it hurts”. What do you do?[SEP]#GRIFFITH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4.0,"People who rejected a marriage proposal, why?[SEP]We were having the marriage talk and it hit me I wanted children but I just couldn’t picture him being the father. I went for a walk and realized I wasn’t happy I just couldn’t see me growing old with him. Needles to say I left that relationship"
4.0,"People who have had PRK eye surgery, how painful was the recovery?[SEP]It really wasn't. Maybe a bit of pain for the first few days. Then just some extra caution for a few weeks. After that, the only difference is for maybe a year or two if you get stuff in your eye (like when you wake up) it can get scratchy and a bit uncomfortable for a bit, but you get used to it. The primary difference for those who don't know is whether they cut a ""flap"" (LASIK) or remove a layer completely (PRK). Most of the rare complications tend to involve the flap. It's been maybe 8 years since I got it done, my only regret was not doing it sooner."
5.0,"What’s your low key real world super power that no one else you know has?[SEP]Mine is that I can pick the perfect sized tupperware for the amount of food leftover. People will doubt me and say “no way that’ll fit”. It always fits. I just want to be clear, I’m talking about leftovers and tupperware."
4.0,What’s a non-English song you absolutely love?[SEP]Седой Парнишка. Russian anti-war songs blow ours out of the park.
4.0,What do you wish still existed?[SEP]Economic opportunities for people starting with little or nothing.
5.0,"What's the weirdest/ most insane roommate experience you have ever had?[SEP]During my freshman year, I caught a whiff of familiar scent while I was sitting at my desk eating a salad. I followed the scent trail with my nose to the towel hanging on my lofted bed. Turns out he wiped his cum on the towel that I was using to shower. Later, I found out he wiped his cum on the back of my blazer. This was after he had stolen a bunch of my food and other things. He got addicted to xans, dropped out, and now works landscaping. Karma"
5.0,"What's the stupidest food anyone ever created?[SEP]There’s this fermented shark from... a Scandinavian country... I want to say... Iceland? Anyway. This fermented shark is only caught in extremely cold waters and apparently sharks are unfortunately a large portion of by-catch in this country. I don’t know f you know this but sharks are just full of ammonia, which is you know... poison. This shark in particular, produces a shit ton of it. Almost as if it wasn’t meant to be safe for human consumption. Well, where there’s a will, there’s a way. It’s fermented for god knows how long and the strong ammonia flavor apparently doesn’t go away. I just... I don’t mean to be shitting on anyone’s “delicacy” but I just don’t understand why you would go through such lengths to consume a food that may make you go blind if you eat it when it isn’t ready. Also how the hell did they discover this process of “purifying” the shark meat? How many people died for this?"
4.0,"What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Christians?[SEP]That they have to be utterly arrogant in order to hold onto these beliefs. Like, isn't it the epitomy of arrogance to believe that the entire cosmos was made specifically with YOU in mind? That's so incredibly self-centered and arrogant that I have trouble accepting that this really is what people believe. Even worse, they actually go out of their way to assert that their beliefs are in fact humble, when they are the exact opposite."
4.0,"What’s the best hangover cure?[SEP]Pickle juice, or another shot"
4.0,"Who are you jealous of? Why?[SEP]I'm jealous of Nintendo fans. Or to be more precise, Mario fans I'm a Sonic fan and I can't help but look in envy at Nintendo fans as they get everything. Good reviews, good games, not being hated on by the internet, not having your favourite games bashed on because someone on YouTube said so, not having to deal with loud cringy fans, etc. People like IGN, Watch Mojo, Zero Punctuation loves to mock us, make fun of us, laugh at us and constantly talk about Sonic 06 and Sonic BOOM as if that's the only Sonic games that exists. Meanwhile they keep on singing praises of Nintendo and they hardly ever say anything bad about them. They also talk shit about my favourite games, being extremely nit pickings and saying a game is bad for hypocritical reasons (So Link turns into a Wolf and nobody blinks. But when Sonic does it everyone goes crazy) and [some game revieiwers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHC99ZkdWI) show that they can't play the game. Like [jumping over a dash pad in Sonic Unleashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjyWXiZrSlQ). Also some YouTubers are spreading lies that the best Sonic games like Unleashed, Adventure and [Adventure 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgG--74XExY) are bad. And the worst part is that people will believe them. Nintendo fans don't have to deal with it as they get good reviews and everything left right and center Also people love to make fun that there are ""too many Sonic characters"" and make fun of our cringy fandom (that is only 10% of our population), while there are fandoms that are worse. and our last game was Sonic forces, while Mario fans got Mario Odyssey and Zelda fans got Breath of the Wild. In fact almost all of our (Sonic games) last games in the last 20 or so years are outclassed or not held up to standard or was overshadowed by a Nintendo game. The only time we had a game that was held up to be just as good was in the 90's. Now, we would be lucky if our game was an honorable mention in the ""Top 20 games of the year"". The only 'bad' Mario and Zelda games are the CD I games and they don't really count as Nintendo had nothing to do with it. There are only two things we have above Nintendo fans. more media (shows, comics and movies) and permission to make fangames."
2.0,What are the things you should start planning as your parents grow older?[SEP]How to wipe my own arse
4.0,Which celebrity do you find physically unattractive?[SEP]Mindy Kaling…I cannot fucking stand her in anything and have to turn whatever she is in off immediately…and no I do not understand this repulsion.
5.0,"Is the recent discovery of a prostetic arm that can generate feel a proof for physicalism?[SEP]No. (1) This does not ""solve"" anything. That you can manipulate experience and feeling through physical manipulation isn't anything new. The point is to find an explanation. (2) It doesn't disprove any opponents of physicalism. Dualists have often maintained psycho-physical connections or laws (or may be sometimes, epiphenomenalism). Panpsychists too doesn't have to say anything different here. Idealists (depending on the variant) don't even believe in non-mental physical stuff in the first place; they will just say you are modulating some conscious experience through the ""image of physical"" acting as an interface, but still being within the mind nonetheless. It doesn't even threaten ancient pre-scientific non-materialist positions, to be honest. (3) I am not saying this cannot act as an evidence for physicalism in some sense, but those who find physicalism problematic would still find it problematic; this doesn't bring anything new to the table."
4.0,"ELI5, Why do we use oil in our car engines?[SEP]Engine oil has several problems that transmission fluid does not have: * It has to deal with much higher temperatures since some engine parts get very hot (like turbochargers or pistons). * It gets diluted by fuel and moisture because the engine isn't sealed like a transmission. * It comes into contact with exhaust gas that leaks past the pistons, and exhaust gas in conjunction with moisture will form acidic compounds In short, it needs to be changed because it degrades and ages in several different ways."
4.0,"Would Black Canary be stronger if she had a microphone, megaphone, or some other sound-amplifying device?[SEP]She can break metals and shatter Earth. She's loud enough to [rip the sky.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples) What sort of megaphone could help with that?"
5.0,"What is somehing you have said or done while being under anesthesia that needs to be told?[SEP]When I had my wisdom teeth taken out they put me under with laughing gas. When I woke up I ripped out the heart monitor and staggered upright, knocked over the tray of instruments and Frankensteined my way right out the door to the parking lot where I lit a cigarette. The dentist staff all came outside and tried to get me to put out the cigarette and come back inside but I was belligerent and refused to listen. They shoved me in a cab with some prescriptions and I was gone. I ended up eating all the pain pills they gave me in like 2 days and had to go back for more. I lied to the dentist and said that I spilled the pills down the sink by accident and he said ""Based on that mushroom necklace you have on and the smell of marijuana coming from you I doubt that"". He still gave me the script though lol."
3.0,What’s the best thing you ever purchased at a thrift store/yard sale/2nd hand?[SEP]I bought this jacket I loved Found out a year or 2 later it was woman’s jacket lmao
5.0,"ELI5: How are software update numbers assigned, for example version 22.13.001 vs 22.14.001 vs 23.01.001... what would be required to change one number vs the others?[SEP]The number is up to the developer and different developer change them in different way. A common way is the X.Y.Z variant. X is the major version number. Y in the minor version number. Z is the patch. So X changes when you consider is major changes. It might be that non backwards compatible charges, other major chages or just that you do that because you charge for uppdates to new major version. Y change when you do minor changes to the software. Z changes when you fix bugs or similar small changes. But that is just a common way to do it. As a developer you can do it anyway you like. You could release software and decrease the number start at 100 and next version is 99. It might be stupid thing to do and it confuse people that use it but you could do it There can be requirement of what to do if you use some external services like app stores to distribute the software so updates etc works"
5.0,When should you not apologize?[SEP]When they’re blaming you and you *know* it wasn’t your fault
3.0,"Hey, reddXers, you got a cell phone; what do you still have written down?[SEP]I kinda assume that ""reddXer"" is a term that is a portmanteau of ""Redditor"" and ""Generation X'er"", but technically I am one of the older if not in the oldest year still counted as being born inside the Millennial Generation. In my field (IT Field Service Technician) some people are patient enough to wait until my smart phone is ready to take the information that they need to give me. Most of them are not, but they are more than patient enough to wait for me to get out a pen and paper, which I keep in a cargo pants pocket, so it doesn't take much time. But I usually just put it into the system of notes I keep on my phone later anyway."
4.0,"Who was your customer from hell?[SEP]There are so many bad customer service stories I can share. There's the lady who bought a flocked Christmas tree that was shedding so she decided to shake it outside then called to ask me how to get rid of the flocking that was outside. There was the guy who didn't want to do something he was required to do by law and even when I showed him the law he was vastly misinterpreting it and when I told that's not what it means he responded with ""that's not what it means to me"" The kids who tried to order a 13"" pizza when we only served 12 or 14"" pizzas and when I told them that one responded with ""14. I thought that would be obvious"" Finally, my very last Wal Mart customer that kept me at the store for over an hour. He was a very old guy and very shaky. He was buying some knee and elbow pads but they rang up for a higher price than what he saw to which I refuted saying these would never be that low of a price but he was insistent. Wal Mart managers didn't give a fuck about being helpful that late at night. It was only after 20 minutes of him arguing that a manager finally had to walk back with him to see and 10 minutes later, sure enough, he mis read the price and he didn't want them anymore. We moved on to his other items until it came time to pay. He was paying in three different ways and wanted $10 back on a check or debit card payment. He already gave the cash which was already entered and in the register. Minimum we can give back is $20. He wanted his cash back but I couldn't re-open the register to get the money or reset his balance to 0 without a managers approval. Ended up having to wait another 10 minutes for the manager to come back who just told me to leave and they'd finish taking care of him. It was past midnight at that point and I was supposed to finish at 11."
3.0,When was the last time you tried to activate any dormant superpowers you may have?[SEP]A spider bit me. I tried to activate the superpowers as soon as I woke up the next morning upside down.

3.0,"What was a movie you thought would be great, but turned out to be an absolute disappointment?[SEP]Probably Titanic. It’s a movie about this unsinkable ship that *spoilers* fucking sinks."
5.0,"What is the strangest thing that you saw that you can't explain?[SEP]There is an attic hatch in the upper hallway of my house. It's basically a piece of wood that sits in place and you push it up and out of the way when you want to go up there. In order to do this you need a step ladder as it's like 12ft off the ground. One day it was ""ajar"", i.e as if someone had been up there and not put it back properly. I have no explanation for this: there is no homeless person living up there; the attic is pretty air tight, so it couldn't have been caused by wind. I have literally no explanation for this."
4.0,"What do you think of this argument against the existence of god from duty?[SEP]Why do they have that duty? Just because God is loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful, based on your assumption, why do they have a duty to manifest the truthfulness of their existence? Is this duty merely part of your assumption? If duty is part of your assumption, then your argument is flawed as you already assume the answer as part of your question. It would be the same as saying: 1. God is good and because he is good he would not send people to Hell 2. God sends people to Hell 3. Since God sends people to Hell, God is not good Whilst the logic is okay, your assumptions do resort to sophistry - they make sense logically, but not semantically. In my example, I am falling for the same flaw as you - I simply assume that a good God wouldn't send people to Hell, but this isn't clear why. I'm just playing around with the definition which is pretty much sophistry. For your argument to hold weight, you should make it clear why there is a direct link between ""loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful"" with this ""duty"" God has to manifesting himself to his diligent seekers. Whilst the logic is okay, your assumptions do resort to sophistry - they make sense logically, but not semantically. In my example, I am falling for the same flaw as you - I simply assume that a good God wouldn't send people to Hell, but this isn't clear why.

For your argument to hold weight, you should make it clear why there is a direct link between ""loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful"" with this ""duty"" God has to manifest himself to his diligent seekers. Overall, I don't see a problem with the logic. The first assumption just doesn't have sound reasoning behind it... yet."

5.0,"What did you forgive a partner for that you wish you hadn’t?[SEP]My hubby got taken in by a Russian bride scam and I should have just walked away. I had a hysterectomy a few years back and he decided in all of his wisdom that as I did not have any kids with him, he was going to look elsewhere. Needless to say, he was contacted by a scammer and he was taken in hook, line and sinker. It was up to the stage that they were asking him for money when he finally came clean and he tried blaming me for his wayward behavior. Naturally a huge argument ensued and despite me telling him he was an idiot taken in by a scam, he thought this woman was going to come from Russia and solve all of his problems. After all was said and done, like an idiot, I forgave him and stayed with him. The irony with me not having kids with him was that he knew for 15 years that I could not have kids as I had my tubes tied. I kick myself periodically now for staying but it is what it is."
4.0,What's the worst possible thing you could hear before going under for surgery?[SEP]Have we found a YouTube tutorial video of this surgery yet??

4.0,"What's something you bought that you didn't end up using?[SEP]A guitar, a set of golf clubs, assorted arts and crafts materials, games on steam. A used dirt bike, on which I injured myself during the first ride."
5.0,"Short stories or a Novella?[SEP]Definitely try to stretch your limits with a novella, especially if you want to publish longer works in the future. The only way to really get better at writing longer works is by writing longer works. If your only goal is publishing, I'd caution you, though. It's a difficult path to be traditionally published, or to earn even a modicum of success in self-publishing or traditional publishing. If you leap into writing these works with the sole objective of publication, and you find yourself getting rejected, it will feel more like a failure, in my experience. Writing anything is incredibly difficult, and merely finishing a novel, novella, or short story that you're satisfied with is an incredible accomplishment. Don't sweat it if you don't get published from the get go. Most writers who started writing young didn't publish a book until their 30's, so you've got plenty of time to work on your craft. If I were you, I would look into literary magazines as well, especially if you have some short stories you're proud of. It's still super difficult to get a story published, but less so than a collection or novella. Traditional publishers aren't super keen on short story collections or novellas. That doesn't mean you shouldn't write them, that just means publishing is doubly difficult. Short story publications for literary magazines will help you get used to rejections on a smaller scale, make connections, and get an understanding for how editors, publishers, and the literary world works. Most writers got their start publishing in magazines, and there's a ton online to look into. Hope that helps, and good luck with your writing!"
3.0,"ELI5: How are maglev trains protected against CMEs?[SEP]They really aren't. The majority of the worlds current infrastructure isn't suited to handle CMEs on a direct path towards Earth. Maglev tracks like those of a standard railway are a combination of many smaller pieces of either electromagnets or super conducting magnets. These individual pieces can't get as large of an induced current as the thousands of miles of wire used to transport the electricity. The controllers that run the electromagnets most likely have some form of protective relay or fuse that would blow if a large enough current is pushed through as well. There is also plenty of other conducting material to shield some of the internals. Overall, I don't this there is any active protection for maglevs against CMEs and if it gets the point where they are affected you have much larger problems to worry about such as planes falling from the sky."
4.0,"Eli5: Why are we so picky about having the right amount of salt in our food?[SEP]Salt is a flavour enhancer. It enhances the flavor of the existing ingredients, but can overpower the food if too much is added."
2.0,What superpower would make your job easier and why?[SEP]The ability to give a shit would help
5.0,"eli5 that If most foods raise insulin levels, how does a ketogenic diet work?[SEP]It’s not the same as calorie restriction. Insulin is released by the pancreas and while there is a sugar sensor there to release it, there are also various other mechanisms that influence the release of insulin. Some of these include signals that your stomach and intestines send to the pancreas. This explains why we know that orally ingested glucose will cause a greater spike in insulin than IV injected glucose. Your body normally uses carbs as it’s fuel source, they’re readily available and quick and easy to use. Extra are stored by the liver and extra extra carbs can be chemically modified to be stored as fat. By not eating carbs and relying on fats and proteins, you deplete your body’s carb reserves within a couple of days. This then reverses that fat storage process and will convert the stored fat to energy and occasionally back into glucose. There is a lot of nasty biochemistry underneath this explanation, but that is the gist of what is going on."
4.0,"ELI5: How do 3D printers work?[SEP]They work in a variety of ways, but the most common two types are FDM and SLA. FDM aid basically a computer controlled glue stick. It squeezes a long thin bead of semi molten plastic from a nozzle, which cools and hardens after it has left the nozzle. The part is split into layers, and the glue stick draws the outline of the layer, and then colours in the middle. It the moves up one layer and does it again until all the layers have been drawn. SLA uses a bath of liquid, which turns solid if you shine a bright light at it. So it uses a laser to draw on the liquid turning it solid layer by layer, much like the FDM a process drawing the outline and then colouring in the middle. The liquid is in a transparent tray and the laser shines up from below. There is a platform in the liquid which leaves a thin gap one layer in height to which the solidified liquid sticks. Once each layer is complete this platform moves up by one layer, leaving a thin layer of liquid under the solidified part, stuck to the platform and it all starts again."
5.0,What would you do if you became a Millionaire over night?[SEP]I would save it or invest it. 1 Million is not enough to stop working.
4.0,"What's the weirdest thing to ever happen to you in a public restroom?[SEP]I was taking a leak a urinal in a Sears restroom once and heard a camera click. Looked down and saw a hand holding a phone sticking out from under the toilet stall next to me, with the camera pointed up at me. I turned a little and aimed my pee stream towards him and soaked his hand and phone. He screamed ""Oh God!"" And dropped the phone. I kept pissing on it while he tried to pick it up and dragged it back into the stall. He wouldn't come out of the stall after so I washed up and left the restroom, just to stand right outside and wait. When the camera man finally came out it was a middle aged dude in a nice suit. He was obviously upset that his arm was soaked in urine, and got even more upset when I yelled ""Pervert!"" As he tried to hurry out of the store. He took off running and knocked over a few displays on his way out the door."

4.0,"When did you accidentally/unknowingly expose someone for cheating and how did it go?[SEP]I was eight and saw a shit ton of naked women on someone's laptop (he gave it to me to play with) and one looked suspiciously like the front desk lady at his workplace. Casually said ""Hey auntie Z, uncle Z has naked pictures of Cate on his laptop!"""

3.0,"How are we to understand the great movements in the last few centuries (enlightenment, modernization, scientific revolution, industrial revolution, secularism, etc.)?[SEP]&gt; How are we to understand the great movements in the last few centuries (enlightenment, modernization, scientific revolution, industrial revolution, secularism, etc.)? I'm not quite sure what you're asking here. I mean, in general, I'd say that if you want to understand these things, you read reliable scholarship on this topic. In this sense, the answer is pretty simple. Though, of course, doing it will require a lot of work. &gt; are the characteristics we ascribe to each movement actually ideas that were in the minds of people in that time, or have we just back-projected things onto them? Ideas about these things in popular media (or in remarks in scholarship that isn't on this topic but included as ""popular wisdom"" or whatever) tend to just reimagine this period in a way that pleases whatever ideological point someone wants to make. And this often involves projecting one's own values back onto an imagined past. Though, this is a reason to eschew such commentary and get into reliable scholarship -- if one is interested in understanding such things."
4.0,"American men, is getting your first chest/armpit hair really as big a deal to you guys as your TV shows and movies make it out to be?[SEP]I see everyone saying no. In my family it's huge! I remember looking in the mirror at my arm pits everyday to see if they were growing yet!"
4.0,"What is your weirdest tinder date experience?[SEP]She brought her friendzoned simp with her, ""for company."" Like WTF."
4.0,"What was the scariest experience you've had that might have defied all logic?[SEP]For me it was when I was a kid. My dad's uncle was a sheep herder who lived in a rural village where people were mostly farmers. We used to visit them sometimes. It was dinner time, so I went to the backyard to wash my hands. The uncle had a large pen where he kept the sheep inside. The whole thing was covered up by a roof and wooden walls except for a window next to the door. As I sat there rinsing my hands I felt strange so naturally I started scanning the perimeter. I glanced at the wooden window, it was dimly lit from the reflection of the backyard's only light bulb but it was enough for me to make out the silhouette of a furry horned being that was staring at me. I ran inside as fast as possible. Fast-forward to 6am when the uncle took out the sheep for grazing. I hadn't slept much that night so I looked out the window, expecting to spot a ram or a goat coming out. But none of the sheep had horns, and no sheep would be tall enough to look through that window. I was only 8 but I can still picture those two eyes staring at me."
4.0,"Through the history of time, many songs have been given the title “masterpiece” though it may not truly be that. What is a song you genuinely consider a masterpiece?[SEP]Boring answer, but Bohemian Rhapsody. There's so many turns in mood and music style, and it's very theatrical."
5.0,"I’ve never been on a plane, and barely been inside an airport, but now I am about to start flying at least every 6-8 weeks. Is there anything I should know?[SEP]Well done for doing something new like this OP. If you’re travelling with big bags, you’ll be dropping them off first. They’ll weigh them at the baggage counter (usually well signposted or close to the doors) and away they go. Then you’ll go through security. This is just where they’ll check your smaller suitcase, make you go through a metal detector (or scanner) and assess whether or not they need to test anything for anything. A lot of the time, you have to take large electronics out of your suitcase and put them on a tray on their own. You won’t be able to take large liquids through and all of your small liquids should be in a clear plastic bag out of your suitcase. You might get patted down after you go through the metal detector, you might not. Once all is well, you go down a very clever path that usually takes you past shops and places to eat, depending on the size of the airport. Your gate should be clearly signposted so that you know where you’re going, but people will be happy to help if you ask. You usually show your passport before boarding if you’re flying international and you should have your boarding pass ready. You board the plane, pop your small case in an overhead locker, any smaller bags can usually go under the seat in front of you. Keep your tray up where it is for takeoff. Usually the people working onboard will do a safety demonstration as the plane is being taxied to the runway. This is all normal and something done on every flight. The setting off can be a little fast on the ground, especially if the runway is bumpy. But, it’s usually over and done very quickly because the plane is much smoother as it lifts, it then doesn’t feel quite so fast. There can occasionally be a lot of turbulence when taking off so I would expect some shaking just to be safe. Sometimes it can be bumpy. Up at altitude, it’s often much smoother with pockets of turbulence. Try not to let these worry you. I’m terrified of flying and a travel blogger so I completely understand if they do, but nothing bad will happen because of them and pilots will often talk to each other about bad pockets to try avoid them. Good luck OP, I’m sure everything will go fine!"
4.0,"How do I [M20] become a fun person?[SEP]Find your definition of fun. Everyone has different interests, whether it’s gaming or sports - something that can keep you fully engaged on a regular basis."
5.0,"ELI5: Why do my Cheerios in milk act like magnets with different polarities causing them to repel or attract each other?[SEP]Milk likes milk more than it likes air. When a cheerio floats on milk, it has milk in/on it, which attracts* the other milk molecules and pulls them up. You can see the surface of the milk curves up to meet the cheerio. When you have 2 cheerios, the curved parts like each other more than they like air, so they behave like magnets. * I'm not sure if ""attraction"" is the right word here, it's more that the milk is taking the path of least resistance. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerios_effect"
4.0,"If everyone in the world was motivated enough and our goal was to liberate North Korea and help the people, how could we best do it?[SEP]Cut off all contact with them. All aid. All trade. The revolution will be quick and bloody, but the least bloody option, really."
4.0,What are your wierdest school stories?[SEP]So one of my friends brother ejaculated in a chick's water bottle cause he apparently 'had a crush on her and wanted to show his love for her'. It was recess time everyone were outside and this dude and a bunch of his friends were helping him do the thing he was wanking while they were covering him(there were cameras in every class) The same day when she drank out of her bottle she felt wierd so she told her mom( who is a physics teacher in the school) about the wierd taste and ironically there was a biology teacher right beside them so she had a doubt and wanted to examine the water under a microscope which made them realise it was sperm so they checked the camera footage to see who did the act The kid was initially suspended for 3 months but their parents were so embarrassed they removed him from the school Idk if the microscope shit was true but the ejaculation part was definitely true
4.0,"I’m American and have had it with this country. I want to move to Europe, but don’t have a specific place in mind. Where should I look? Where is best for a young-ish family?[SEP]I'd say one of the Scandinavian countries like Finland, Norway or Denmark. I hear that those countries are one of the best in the world. I mean if you look up the happiest countries in the world you will most likely find 5 Scandinavian countries at the top 10. I live in Belgium and it's pretty great here as well, but IMO the Scandinavian countries are the best. Good luck!"
3.0,"This might reveal your age a bit, but what is the earliest memory you have of a world event that took place?[SEP]I have shitty memory but one of my most prominent memories of a world event would be the Boston Bombing"
2.0,What are some awesome female names that could be used for an OnlyFans Account?[SEP]What about Dirty Dumpster? I never say no call my Miss PIGGY
5.0,"Why are different cameras used for action scenes?[SEP]Might not be different cameras. In my experience filming, I’d guess that it’s likely the frame rate. Different frame rates create different moods. For instance, when I film real estate houses for agents I export in ~25fps to give a wispy, cinematic feel. If I’m filming a movie with a high speed car chase, I might bump it up to 30fps to catch the flames and realism while still keeping that cinematic feel. If you watch a football game, they typically put it in 60fps+ to make it feel like you’re actually AT the game. Sometimes when movies switch the FPS it can ruin the mood. Out of curiosity, what movie/scene had a harsh transition that ruined the mood for you? Edit: this video illustrates the difference using extreme ends. There are commonly used FPS speeds that fall in between these intervals."
5.0,"How do you get over someone throwing you away like rubbish?[SEP]Although this is true in a way "" “How could they treat me with so little respect?” I know that the answer is because I let them."" I don't think it's really accurate. The reason they could treat you with so little respect has nothing to do with you or what you allow. It has to do with them and the decisions that they made. People who treat others like this do it to anyone. It's not about you specifically. You didn't do anything to cause it or deserve it. Your value and self-worth must come from within and not from others."
3.0,Which game do you think deserves a film adaptation?[SEP]The Grand Theft Auto series
3.0,What are some things humanity knows that it will never know?[SEP]What the ocean looks like

5.0,"Have you ever had a dream that made you wake up screaming? If so, what was it, and what did you think it meant?[SEP]I had a dream, when I was a child, that someone was breaking into my house, assaulting my mom, and robbing us. In the dream, I became suspended in the air and couldn't move. He was assaulting her and I could do anything due to my suspension. I felt absolutely helpess beyond anything you could imagine. I screamed ""ROBBER!"". It woke me up and my mom up and she started freaking out. My mom had dated a couple scumbags back then, and money problems were always a thing. She was always very anxious about people breaking in,, claiming claiming hear the doorknob twisting in the middle of the night, stuff like that.. Feeling as though I needed to protect her (single mom, Father left) was always very hard on me. It was kind of me and her against the world. I was always scared something like that would happen. Especially when she's was having issues with men. I'm sure this is a pretty common amoung young men who are raised by single moms."
5.0,"Any advice for friend-making (or at the very least, beating loneliness and boredom) when you move to a brand new city where you don't know anyone?[SEP]Hobbies are a great place to start. There's a website called Meetup where people organize groups to gather and do things like draw together or have a bookclub. Try out a few different groups and see what you like. Facebook is another good place. I've found pages of groups that meet up to go hiking, go running, play volleyball, or do theatre cold reads. Some cities even have a page about the city where people can look for recommendations or places to eat or where to get a good haircut. Try posting a bit about yourself and your interests and say you're new in town and would like to meet some new friends. I've met people at the gym (I went at the same time every day, and always ran into the same girl, eventually we became friends) , or joining a class like yoga, jiu jitsu, boxing, spin class. Or maybe your interests lie more in things like culinary classes, woodworking, language learning, photography, or painting workshops. Do you like to volunteer? Thats another great way to meet people. &amp;#x200B; In the meantime (so long as your city is open for it right now) take yourself out on a few dates and be a tourist in your new city, there's usually lots to explore and ask people (ppl like cashiers, waitresses etc) what they would recommend doing, or good coffeeshops in the area. People usually love talking about the local attractions and its a just another conversation piece. Plus if you know at least one good coffee shop in the area its easy to ask someone if they want to grab a quick cup of coffee after work or class or whatever."
4.0,Do you think aliens exist? Why or why not?[SEP]yes 1) if we count the living bacteria on other planets then those are technically aliens but 2) so much of space is unexplored but somehow we’re the only known thing out there??? nah i dont believe that
2.0,"People often say ""no offense"" before saying something offensive, what are the other things you saw people say/do contradicting what they say/do?[SEP]Don't take this the wrong way"
5.0,"What is an irrational fear that actually happened?[SEP]Trains, ever since I was a child I was terrified of trains. I'd hold my breath across train tracks. My first year driving I left work really late at night. I was crossing train tracks when the dividers came down and the sound started I floored the gas and the second divider busted my rear windshield. Seconds later the train came barreling through. I was terrified and shaken to the core. I parked my car on the side and called my dad sobbing and freaking out. Fear validated."
3.0,How can you tell if someone is telling the truth and how can you tell if someone is telling you a lie?[SEP]You can only rely on their body language..there are no absolutes. The only exception was my ex girlfriend...she lied about everything.
5.0,"What is the weirdest incident that you remember, that could’ve been a scene out of a movie?[SEP]Remember how we all used to laugh at how unrealistic all those stuns in action movies were and how the main character came out of them untouched? One time I was riding my bike that the brakes were broken in and this one car appeared out of nowhere right in front of me. Flipped over the car and landed on my feet unscratched, meanwhile my bike left a mark on his driver's side door. The guy didn't even complain since we both knew it was his fault for not checking both sides before turning and so he made sure I was okay (which I was) and left without another word. at least those movie scenes don't seem so unrealistic anymore."
4.0,"Tips for how to completely forget someone exists?[SEP]One, the do exist, but, they don't exist in your mind anymore, no matter what they did, it's I've, it's in the past you can't change it. You just have to know when to say ""fuck you"" and get your mind off of them, it becomes easier with time, but, it hurts for a while with certain people."
4.0,"What's good as a hobby but terrible as a profession?[SEP]Woodworking. I do it as a hobby, i just love it. But i can't imagine to do it as a profession. It is not that i would not want to do it, it is more that i don't want to have to do it, or else my family will starve. I like to stand in my workshop for hours on end, creating things with my hands. I've been told that my furniture would easily sell for thousands of dollaras, but i like to have the choice if i go into my workshop or not. If i do it for a living, i have to go into my shop, even if i don't want to. As a hobby, i want to go into my shop. Or not. Doesn't matter. If i want to spend my day on the couch instead of the workshop, doesn't hurt my wallet even a bit. If i do it as a job, every minute not spent in the shop is lost money. Money, my family and me would desperatly need. That way, woodworking would loose its appeal pretty fast...."
5.0,"My bf family doesn't speak English around me Despite knowing how to. How do I cope with feeling left out?[SEP]I totally understand that. And don't think of yourself as being left out. Your bf's family was a little insensitive, but it could also be that they're more comfortable in their mother tongue. Despite knowing to speak English, they could really have a hard time speaking it. But maybe ask your bf if his family could try to speak in English at least occasionally. They'll get the hint. If they're fluent, then what they're doing is really insensitive and you don't deserve that. Do they like you? Do you get the feeling that they're intentionally doing this?"
2.0,"What keep tracks all of the particles in your brain enabling you to comprehend the symbols and letters in this question at this moment without doubting that you exist?[SEP]Go easy on the LSD, my dude."
4.0,"People working at call centers, what are some of the funniest things you've heard?[SEP]My favourite is still a guy calling to troubleshoot his internet at home...While Driving. Then having an accident while on the phone and being recorded."
4.0,"What's the dumbest thing an employer said to you at an interview?[SEP]when i applied for a housekeeper job, i mentioned that i clean my house for my grandmother and the lady really said “well it’s more than that” and after working there for a week i laughed and told my coworker that my supervisor had me thinking it was more like she claimed and it’s not."
4.0,"What harsh truths did you learn later in your career in corporate?[SEP]HRs have the worst personalities of all people. They're usually narcissists and good liars. If you even so much as plan going against a company, they'll come after you with all their might."
3.0,What is something “cringey” that you do/enjoy that you’d never tell people you actually know about?[SEP]Shitty puns and dumb YTP jokes like SoS and FaaF
4.0,"When do you know it is a racial fetish and not just ""has a type""?[SEP]You encounter person of prefered type. Do you treat them as equals? Or do you treat them as their trait? Ie: you like Chinese ladies. Do you see and understand them as people who are also Chinese, but you like their hair type or their fashion styles more so than someone who isnt Chinese? Or do you see them as exotic, submissive little ladies and get upset when they dont behave that way? Fetishes usually come with the connotation of objectification. The target of a fetish is usually one that illicits only sexual feelings? I dont know if i did a good job explaining, but i hope it might help anyway."
4.0,"What type of pet do you have, and what is their name?[SEP]A gray tabby cat named Khan."
4.0,"Is it toxic that my gf hates my best friend, who is also a female?[SEP]From what I can read it sounds like this is very much out of the guy's hands in this scenario. Jealousy is a really hard emotion to overcome once seeds have been planted. My advice would be to think hard about what matters more to him, the 7 year friendship or the 5 month relationship with his gf. Then make a decision about which one matters more. It's not an easy choice, but if you feels she's already being toxic you have every right to not be in the relationship."
3.0,What would happen if coffee no longer existed?[SEP]I’d be useless any earlier than 11am
3.0,"what would you do if your best friend doesn’t like your crush? because they think if you’re in a relationship you won’t talk to them as much?[SEP]To be very blunt your friend is either: 1. Very insecure regarding your friendship and is projecting their fears on a person who they feel may take some, or all, of your time from them Or 2. Has romantic feelings for you and is threatened by the idea that you may be interested in another person that isn’t them"
2.0,How different the world would be if all the people on earth spoke one language ?[SEP]It would be awfully bland.
2.0,What is the most ominously kind thing you can say to someone?[SEP]Your skin is.... nice. \*deep moan\*
3.0,What is your favorite episode of SpongeBob SquarePants?[SEP]The Algae's Always Greener
4.0,"What way do you accidentally injure yourself the most every year (ex: tripping up the stairs)?[SEP]I’ve broken my pinky toe at least twice when I’m not looking where I’m going, or I misjudge the closeness of something and ram my hips into the corners of walls, or I get scratched by chicken wire or something else sharp, or I bonk my head because I again misjudge my body mainly my height and bonk it against low ceilings or other low places like a branch or something (I’m 6ft btw)"
4.0,"What should be free, but isn't?[SEP]Everything that is essential to living So water, some basic purely nutritional food, education, etc"
4.0,"Those who did not like learning math in school, what is it about math that is so unappealing?[SEP]I loved math I didn't like my teachers telling me we would never walk around with calculators in our pockets so we needed to show the work. I only have 2 words for those teachers now... Hey siri 😂"
3.0,At what moment do you realise you are old?[SEP]When I started going to bed at the same time I used to just be getting started to go out to the bar.
5.0,"Therapists, what are some of the most difficult kinds of problems or thinking patterns to treat in a patient?[SEP]Honestly, people who want something to be wrong with them. I work with people who have a variety of diagnoses but nothing is more difficult than those with the thinking that theirs was a worse/is incurable. I actually work with people who I would give grim prognoses to and they are more engaged, willing, and hopeful than the others. I pick them any day of the week than those who create their own problems."
5.0,"Travelers who left home without a plan, how did it go?[SEP]The day after I graduated from high school, I jumped in the car (1988 Camaro) and drove to Florida. I drove to Florida to see my brother before he got married. He had just moved to Florida to find a job and a place to live before he got married. Florida was awful but we had fun anyway. He didn’t have any furniture so we slept on the floor for three weeks. We were pour, young, and didn’t know any better. At the time, the Burger King across the street had 99 cent whoppers. We ate whoppers three times a day and spent the days at the beach. My brother and his fiancé had a romantic notion of living on the beach. After a year of hating Florida, barely finding work, and missing family, they came home to the Midwest and have been happy ever since. Oh yeah, I got pulled over 14 times in the three weeks for an out-of-state license check."
5.0,"ELI5: For old school records, once they got the sound recorded as a scratch, how did they get that scratch on a hard metal disk for mass production?[SEP]You take the lacquer mold which recorded the scratch, spray it with silver nitrate and the silver nitrate would dissolve the lacquer leaving a thin layer of silver on the master disc in the shape of the scratch. Once the silver was in place they would then lay down coatings of nickel and/or copper on the back side of the silver usually either chemically or via electroplating. Once the backing was thick and stiff enough they could etch away the silver leaving the (positive) metal master in a harder, more durable metal like nickel, or copper, or an alloy of the two. From that positive metal master they would make negative stamping plates. To make the stamping plates they would apply a chemical to the top of the metal master that acts as a sort of lubricant to make it easier to separate the new copy from the metal master. Think putting butter on a waffle iron. Then they would electroplate on top of that chemical layer with nickel. Once the electroplating is thick enough they separate the new electroplate negative from the metal master. Then they electroplate the top of the stamping negative with chromium to make it more scratch resistant. Then they pop it on the press and start stamping vinyl."
3.0,"what possesses people to be so disgusting in public restrooms?[SEP]I don’t have an *answer* to this, but I want to thank you for asking!!! As a retail manager, with a public restroom in our store, I’ve seen some disgusting and intentional bathroom behavior, to be sure. But, *really*, even just the lack of basic bathroom *etiquette* by a “normal” person is what really blows my mind... As a cis female, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve walked into a public stall and practically lost my mind bc there was so much urine on the seat... are there people squatting on top of the seat and hula hooping while they per right over the toilet?? Do they just think they might get an STD if they sit down and aren’t very good at squatting? I truly don’t get it"
2.0,What’s something people say that makes you cringe every time?[SEP]Sheeeeesh I feel like I'm getting old but this trend is just lost on me
4.0,"Men, what questions do you have for women that you’re too scared to ask?[SEP]Why is communication and agreement of an action prior to it happening so important?(in relationships) I have learned that it is to many (not all), and act accordingly but it’s something as a male I have never truly understood as I don’t care what you do with your days and if it were only my opinion that mattered I’d be happy to just do things as they come up and not have to worry about discussing it. Not meant in a rude way at all, just a concept I can’t seem to comprehend fully"
3.0,What do you wish for right now- other than an icecream?[SEP]Hmm... A huge land for myself on a colder climate. Its hot here in Asia right now. Ahhhh. How do people able to wear jacket when its literally 38°C.
4.0,"People who grew up and achieved their childhood dreams, what's your story?[SEP]This is gonna sound really weird, but when I was younger I really wanted to join the military and travel the world, I came from a pretty humble background and the military was unfortunately one of the only ways I could really leave where I am from (think massively remote and pretty bad economicly) I managed to get in the military and I've served 12 years, but there was alot of struggles and you realise if you achieve your goals you still have to sacrifice alot and it's never smooth sailing. I had alot of bad stuff happen as well which really changed the way I viewed the military (I won't disclose too much here) but I did travel alot as well, but it's pushed me towards the door because I realise as a person I was never really the fit for the military and in fact sometimes the mold for the ideal military person is well, a little bit boring and non progressive. I have other dreams now, which i think are more in line with my true self, I want to do a masters in cybersecurity and see how truly far I can push myself in my career, I also want to see how wonderful I can build a home for me and my wonderful wife."
5.0,"What is something that happened awhile ago but you're still mad about?[SEP]In college. Was in film school. School decided to hold a zombie film festival. I wrote a script which was essentially an adaptation of a WWZ (the book) story. Should have been a home-fucking-run but the film crew decided to ignore the script and film a bunch of random, unrelated bullshit that I couldn't mash into any sort of narrative. It's been almost 10 years and it still irritates the SHIT out of me."
5.0,"How to gain more confidence after poor treatment by others?[SEP]I posted this somewhere else, but it could fit here I think: When I became more indifferent to what others think and just focused on whatever it is I had to do, it was better for me. Not to say swing to the other end and become a misathropic jerk or anything, but a healthy indifference to most peoples opinions is fine. Honestly, the only people whos opinions should matter are those closest to you and whoever is paying you money/giving you grades. Think of it this way: In schools and jobs, when its over, youll never see any of these people again unless you want to, so it doesnt really matter much what they think. Thats just a fact. Ive been to two colleges, in the second one I realized its kinda pointless giving so much mindshare to worrying if these guys like me or not, we'll all be out of here before we know it. So I didnt really think too much about that, I didnt even consistently remember the names of 70% of them actually. I just made my 4-5 good friends who I have a chemistry with who I'll know for years afterwards, everyone else I pay little or no mind, just indifference. College kept me pretty busy, I focused on my business and things worked out."
4.0,"Women and men Are not equal in everything what are your thoughts?[SEP]100% agree. There is little of any things that men and women are equal in. But that can be said of any two groups. Old and young, white/black/Asian/Latino, rich and poor etc. it doesn’t mean that it is a good thing or a bad thing or that being a man is better than being a woman. There are plenty of things women are better at, have advantages over men in, and have privilege as a result of their gender."
3.0,What's the BEST way to MAKE someone end their friendship with you?[SEP]Just talk to them and end it...
3.0,What are some great and historical advances we are close to achieving within the next 10 years?[SEP]We're gonna be able to make an eyeball better than the current human eyes by 24? I might be wrong but it's stupidly close.
4.0,"What were coolest things you use to do in your childhood that today's kids mostly don't even know?[SEP]Maybe not the coolest thing that I did, but one thing that comes to my mind that kids these days have no clue about is recording songs from the radio on a tape. Every Friday, when the most popular songs of the week were played, I would be sitting around the radio and whenever a song I liked came up I would record it. And then at the end just listen to the tape over and over again. And bring those tapes with me on vacation and listen to them on my Walkman. Good times. I hated it though when the DJ would talk through a song I was recording."
5.0,"What is the most actually useful product you've ever bought on a whim?[SEP]One of those lil USB powered desk fans. I live in Florida but I didn't think it would make much of a difference given how small it is, but I was def wrong abt that, it's a goddamn lifesaver when shit gets into the 80s indoors sometimes"
5.0,"ELI5: Why do different gear ratios give different torque? Why isn't it the faster a wheel goes the more torque it has?[SEP]The physical setup should be self-explanatory. If one gear has 24 teeth and another gear has 12 teeth (of the same size), the turning the 24-gear once will turn the 12-gear twice, just because of the size difference. Now, think about the energy you use to turn the gears, or work. The work you put in, minus the losses to friction, will be equal to the work that comes out; this is the conservation of energy. Work is also equal to the integral of force over distance; more simplified, work is equal to force multiplied by the distance this force is applied. So if you are putting work into turning the 24-gear and the 12-gear is turning twice as fast, the work has to balance out. In order for the work to balance out, the force exerted by the 12-gear must be half of the force you're exerting on the 24-gear. F/2 x 2D = F x D. And the same is true the other way. Each turn of the 12-gear moves the 24-gear half as far, so it must exert a force twice as large in order for the work to balance. 2F x D/2 = F x D. Torque is just rotational force. So the gear that spins faster must produce more torque, and the gear that spins slower must product more torque."
3.0,"A suitcase of $1 Million, or your most loved person. You can only save one, but which?[SEP]Small price to pay for 1 million"
5.0,"What makes my writing cringe?[SEP]Just on my very very first impressions (the doc you linked is 98 pages, after all), your writing is completely fine. Trust me when I say we've all seen, and honestly written, stuff which is vastly worse. I will say though that it does feel a bit *writerly*, and that's not necessarily a good thing. I sort of got the feeling that you were trying really hard to inject spice into the opening through the writing itself to make up for the fact that, on the surface, it's just a few mundane kids walking home from school. &gt;“Is this it?” That shadowy voice echoed through his skull once again. That sickening silky voice with those three damn words. This, for example, is just a little much. At least not in context. It's a weird break from the otherwise very solid, but decidedly matter-of-fact prose in the rest of the scene.It's a bit like if Eminem broke into operatic singing mid-verse. Opera isn't *bad*, but its place isn't in the middle of an Eminem verse (unless it's sampled, of course, but then it's not him doing the singing). The only real advice I could give is, I suppose, to just relax. You don't need to justify your writing by trying to sound like ""a writer"". Your voice is perfectly fine. If you feel the urge to add a flourish to a certain description, maybe take a moment and ponder why you feel the need. Also there's a bit to be said about overuse of the ""dangling participle"". I'm not a big fan of that particular term; it strictly refers to the error, but it's more well known than ""absolute phrase"".These are sentences such as: &gt;His backpack bit into his shoulders, *his lower back aching dimly.* &gt; &gt;*Focusing on Matt’s voice,* Aaron could piece together the long disorganized rambling\[...\] &gt; &gt;*Realizing that conversation was going nowhere for him*, he let Matt’s voice fade into garbled background noise. You do this *a lot* and although it's a perfectly valid way of structuring sentences, it really stands out when it's used 3+ times on the first page. Just a heads up."
2.0,"Why is being a “virgin” an insult in today’s generation of the internet?[SEP]People think they are cool for getting laid because it's seen as a big achievement. If you think about how horny people can be, it's really not that impressive."
2.0,you have to wear your last text message on your shirt; what does your shirt say?[SEP]„Remember when I said I felt better 😂😂😂 yeah scratch that I don’t 😂😂😂“ well
4.0,"Why is Wittgenstein in (apperently) no introductory class to phil of language?[SEP]The undergrad course I took covered a bit of Wittgenstein, among all the others, but it turned out that our Prof was simply having us read all the sources that Kripke would cite in *Naming and Necessity*. We spent months behind brainwashed into descriptivists by Russell, Frege, et al, and then two weeks with Kripke changed most of our minds. I know Wittgenstein is deified by many, but I don't regret not spending more time on him in that course, as it pertains specifically to theories of reference. However, since Kripke is hugely influenced by Wittgenstein, it would behoove you to study him in depth to fully understand the intellectual history from Wittgenstein to casual reference. But for a simple survey course, I think it's more important to hit the major arguments and propositions that endured in the discourse, rather than indulging in Wittgenstein as much as would be necessary to really appreciate him. It would come at the cost of too much other material that needs to be covered."
4.0,"What celebrity icon really let you down as a person?[SEP]Ik this person isn’t a celebrity, but Cosmodore. Would’ve never expected the guy that ranks every Spongebob episode in well organized videos to be a groomer."
5.0,"How does Spider Man focus during fights with his non-stop joke telling ?[SEP]Spiderman is like goku in ultra instict. His powers are such that if he moves without thinking his body will move on its own avoiding any danger and punching back with absolute accuracy. He actively has to restrain himself to not punch too hard. So his mind is free to quip, and he lets out his carefree outgoing personality that he repressed when he was a nerdy kid. Plus with the years he saw that his quips got him an advantage. He made the green goblin flee in terror with a quip about his man purse."
3.0,"If you lived within the MCU, and could choose whether or not you were ""blipped"", what option would you go with?[SEP]Being gone for 5 years, and coming back the same age? Yes please."
4.0,You develop a rubber bouncy ball that never loses energy when bounced. What do you do with it and how does this affect the world?[SEP]Donate it to a science lab and see what they do with 100% efficient energy storage.
5.0,"What would you say the best kept secret of your country/culture is?[SEP]I'm English, and go to university up north. About an hour away from where I live, deep in Yorkshire national park, is the town of [Knaresborough](https://www.google.com/search?q=knaresborough&amp;oq=knaresborough&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46i433j0i131i433j0j46i131i175i199i433.3033j0j4&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8) . It really is the most calm, idyllic place. It's stuffed full of beautifully interesting antiques shops, little ice cream shops and locally owned businesses. Barely a single chain cornershop in sight. The locals tend to congregate there in the summer, but over the years I've visited i don't think I've ever seen an (obvious) foreign tourist. If you ever get the chance to visit my beautiful country, i really do suggest you grit your teeth and bare the 4 hour train ride from London. Book a little Airbnb and stay in the area a few nights. I promise you it won't disappoint."
4.0,"When did someone in the military clap back at a sergeant or someone higher up? If so what was th result?[SEP]Again, WW2. When it became obvious even to Hitler that the encircled 6th Army at Stalingrad was going to fail Hitler promoted its commander, Paulus, to Field Marshal. Seems weird, right? Well, the reason was because no German or Prussian Field Marshal had ever been taken alive. They were expected to commit suicide. Paulus not only surrendered himself but pretty much willingly helped the Soviets."
2.0,How do you deal with being everyone’s second choice (Ex: everyone you care about has someone they love/care about more)?[SEP]Don't worry how others feel about you.
3.0,"[Rick and Morty] How much time did Morty experience when he used the save-point device and met that girl who became his girlfriend?[SEP]Probably only a few months, maybe a year at most. Like you said he wasn't significantly older by the end of it."
3.0,"Those that were good at dodgeball in primary school, where are you now?[SEP]Well there isn't a competitive dodgeball sport now is there"
4.0,"if you could go back in time 1000 years and leave one thing from the present day in the past to try and really mess up the future, what are you leaving behind?[SEP]sliced bread. i just feel it would be pretty funny considering the idiom “best thing since sliced bread” and since it was only invented in 1928, it would be really funny"
4.0,What are some non-marvel and non-star wars movies that desperately need a sequel?[SEP]The Iron Giant. Where did he come from? Did Kent freak out because he’s met aliens before and it did not go well? What would the 60s be like with the Iron Giant’s technology? Questions I need answered.
2.0,"If humans lived for 20 years only with the same stages of growth, how would the world be different?[SEP]is this just a theoretical question about lowering the age of consent"
4.0,"If you are driving slow and someone decides to jump in front of your car for free money, but they actually manage to get hurt, will you get in trouble as well? (All of it is caught on a dash cam.) Why or why not?[SEP]There isn't a simple, hard and fast answer, that will apply in all circumstances. If you have dashcam footage that shows you are not at fault, though, you're a lot less likely to get into trouble."
3.0,What could be a turn-off in video games?[SEP]Console menus in PC ports.
4.0,"What is the best (scientific or not) theory you came up with yourself?[SEP]Whippy Space. Whippy Space is a pocket dimension into which all minor items are attracted. Such as sunglasses, keys, TV remotes etc. If a Whippy nexus opens up such items are drawn in, which is why you lose your keys that you just put down a moment ago. The reason it's called Whippy Space is because it is controlled and used by Mr Whippy vans for interdimensional travel. If you recall a hot summer morning and you hear the tune of a Whippy van, you rush to grab your coins and run out into the street with the glorious expectation of a fabulous ice cream only to find..... nothing. The music you heard was the van engaging its Whippydrive, creating a nexus and dissappearing into Whippy Space dragging your keys and uncle Alfreds ornametal bottle opener with it. Whippy Space is also finite and slightly unstable (which is why you can lose stuff without the actual presence of a Whippy van) and operates on a FIFO principle. Once Whippy space is full it will start to eject items in the order in which they were accumulated, so if you want to find your keys the best option is to start losing other minor items until your keys are eventually ejected."
5.0,"Does listening to audiobooks count as “reading?” What do you guys think that listening to a book is better or reading a book?[SEP]The question answers itself. You used the verb ""listening"". So it's not reading, because we already have this other word to describe it. This only bothers people who make a fetish of reading and who think it has some virtue that mere listening doesn't. As to which is better, it depends on the context. For academic reading, a physical book or e-book is better because you can stop and think about it, annotate the text, reread passages to grasp every nuance, cross-reference texts, etc. much easier than with audiobooks. But for the kind of reading for entertainment that most people do, audiobooks and physical books/e-books are equivalent. Audiobooks can even be superior for some purposes. For example, I'm currently doing a project to read all of Shakespeare's plays. I start by reading Marjorie Garber's *Shakespeare After All*, each chapter of which analyzes a different play, then read the corresponding play in a facsimile edition of the First Folio, and finally listen to the audiobook in the Arkangel Shakespeare series to get a sense of what each play is like in performance. Obviously I can't get a sense of what it's actually like in performance if I'm not at least hearing it performed (though I can and do invent imaginary productions in my head as I'm reading). However, in order to consider the plays as literary works, I'm *also* reading the texts and reading analysis of the texts."

3.0,"POV: It's December 9, 1980. You turned on your TV and heard, ""on the evening of December 8, English musician John Lennon of the Beatles was shot in the archway of The Dakota, his residence in New York City"". As tears start flowing down your face, what would be the last thing you'd say?[SEP]Not a drop of liquid would come out of my eyes for that dickhead"

2.0,Fellow men how do you guys dance at festivals and Nightclubs?[SEP]If I'm drunk enough
4.0,What kind of job let’s you be mediocre/not caring and still pays well?[SEP]Administrative gov't work. I make mid 20's/hour and a high school kid could do my job. I can usually get my entire weeks worth of work done in one afternoon.
5.0,"ELI5: How does water evaporate off the ground/our bodies without boiling?[SEP]When a material has a temperature, that means that the average energy of all the molecules is at that specific point. Water molecules evaporate when they have enough energy. Water at for example, 30 degrees, also contains molecules that have enough energy to evaporate. This is because the average is 30 degrees, but there are faster and slower molecules inside. The fast molecules will escape (evaporate) and the temperature of the liquid will go down, because the average is now lower. This is the same principle why sweat can cool you down by evaporating off your skin, even though it isn't at boiling temperature."
5.0,"People who were popular in high school, how's it going now?[SEP]Pretty good. I was a pretty outgoing guy in high school. I was living on my own from 16 going 17 onwards (complicated story), so I had my own place to pretty regularly throw typcial high school parties. Had quite a few looser friendships, with a tight-knit smaller group of friends in the middle of it. Our group ""broke up"" since half of us moved around the country and the other half moved abroad, but we still kinda keep in touch. All of us ended up being either where we wanted to be, or somewhere completely different but still great place. Between the 6 of us, we have a phd in the making, 3 Mscs, 3x taking part in the Olympics, a lot of national and regional athletic achievements, honors for musical achievements (and lots of success in the field), and lots of culinary achievements (and success in the field). I personally continued doing sports all throughout uni and beyond, which helped me get a foot in the door many times by now. I'm now a system engineer at a large company with a moderately successful (couple of national titles + small international successes) athletic side-career. The sports part is nothing compared to competing in the Olympics, but I'm still quite proud of it."
3.0,"What games have you never fully (story or otherwise) completed, any why?[SEP]Monopoly. I feel like this one is self explanatory."
4.0,"ELI5 How does One way vision vinyl sheets work? and what's the scientific principle behind it?[SEP]Even though it’s not quite the same mechanism, it’s actually somewhat similar to a one way mirror. The vinyl has a bunch of small holes that can block a lot of light both ways. In general though there’s a lot more light outside than inside your car. So the light from outside that bounces off the solid parts of the mesh is brighter than the light from inside the car that makes it out through the holes. So, for people outside the car, their eyes focus on the brighter light that reflects off the solid parts of the mesh and they just see it as a solid surface. Inside the car the opposite happens. The dim light from inside your car that bounces off the solid parts of the mesh is dimmer than the light from outside that makes it through the holes. So your eyes will mostly ignore the mesh and see what’s outside."
4.0,"If it wasn't for Gamestop, would you know how the stock market can be manipulated?[SEP]Well back in 2009 tossed all my money, credit and assets into property. I actually had to take free classes to learn how to handle the load (like your mom) and suddenly 10k I had to buy a v8 mustang turned into millions. People say ""you can't read the market"" its because they can't read the market, I don't gamble anymore I'm out of the game. My best advice is buy a shit box econo car, the thirty year shingles, never sell and hold, don't drink best advice I can give to anyone."
2.0,What problems do you have?[SEP]Not anything a billion dollars can’t solve
5.0,"For all the non binary folks, what does that mean to you?[SEP]I am so dissociated from my physical form that I cannot even comprehend the notion of physical form as a component of identity. I've seen cis people take pride in their ""maleness"" and ""femaleness"". I've seen trans people fall into utter despair at the growth of their body with respect to birth sex and the utter euphoric sensations of pushing their growth in a different direction. I've known women who feel ""complete"" with an effeminate figure. I've spoken with men who are *elated* to grow facial hair. I've had fascinating talks with people who feel a sense of ""wholeness"" when their body takes on their ""correct"" form. Meanwhile, I simply just exist. The flesh shell I pilot is only a tool to me. Its current biological status and function are often annoying and undesirable, but I could not honestly say any potential reconfiguration would bring me a sense of pleasure or completeness. It can be stated that gender is the firmware to sex's hardware, and that some people sometimes have the wrong firmware. For those people, often the only available fix is to change the hardware. In terms of myself, I'm not sure my firmware *was* written for any particular hardware. I'm uncertain if it's incompatible with anything, but I do feel certain there's no ""Best Fit""."
4.0,"What Do You Prefer, AMD or Intel for budget?[SEP]AMD for labeling accuracy."
4.0,"What are three perfect films?[SEP]The Wolf of wall street, Constantine and FIGHT CLUB."
5.0,"Parents, what is your “I turned away for two seconds!” story?[SEP]My wife was away and I was home with the kids. My daughter was probably 12 at the time and my son 8. I had to run out to do some quick chores and warned the kids not to fool around. I wasn't outside for 2 minutes when my daughter came running out saying my son had broken his finger. Sure enough they were fooling around, she was giving him a horsey ride and got tired of it but he wouldn't get off so she bucked him off and he landed funny breaking his finger. It resulted in 3 hours of surgery to realign the broken end of the bone, the installation of two pins, and six weeks of follow-up appointments. Wife was not impressed."
4.0,How did you realise you are lgbtq+?[SEP]When I realized everyone else around me cared about the gender of the person they want to be with.
4.0,"How bad would a car accident have to be for you to get launched from the car even with a seatbelt on?[SEP]The seat belt is very close to you so I think for that to happen it would have to be so fast that your body would break in three pieces, but I don't think a car can go that fast. The other way is the car to turn so you would be launched from the chair to the roof. In neither those options the seat belt would break Of course, there's the option where the plastic thing that connects the sear belt to the car breaks, that's way more likely"
4.0,"What type of third-person narrator should I aspire to be?[SEP]Personally I like it when the narrator has a character of their own when they're nor a part of the actual story. It could be done by the narrator having opinions on the situation or just simply having a very distinct voice. Neutral narrators are boring af. An opinionated narrator feels like an actual humab being telling you a story, another character to explore, something interesting in the text during some more boring parts of the story itself. There's so much cool stuff you can do with a not neutral narrator! The only thing to remember is to stay consistant and not to preach too much. Share an opinion and move on, don't give your readers a lecture on morals. And I honestly don't see how giving an opinion on character's actions would keep the readers from having their own opinions. You don't have to agree with the narrator just as you don't have to agree with a character. I think if being a more biased narrator is more natural to you, you should work on perfecting that instead of trying to force yourself into a more neutral tone that would be harder for you to maintain."
3.0,"What is the correct way to make lemonade from lemons?[SEP]When I worked at Raising Canes in my younger days we would just get some Lemons put them on this juicer thing and get all the juice out, throw away the peel and put a bunch of sugar in that shit and mix it."

3.0,"Without saying what your mistake was, what was your excuse?[SEP]I did it know she was under 18! I swear!"
4.0,"Who is your favorite from your mom's boyfriends?[SEP]After the divorce, my mom knew she'd never marry again so she didnt really bring her boyfriends around much. The only one I met more than a couple of times was Tom, and it was never for more than 10 mins at a time or so. I remember he had a very hippie-ish look/style and seemed super laid back in general. Tom was uncomfortable around kids, I could tell even as an 7th grader, but he was always nice and spoke to me about my pets and volleyball and stuff. One Christmas I stayed with my dad, and since he was under the impression that his 13 yr old daughter was a 45 yo obese man, I got nothing but a XXXL John Deere shirt. Came home feeling pretty rough about it and Mama said Tom had sent me something and it was on the tree. It was a $30 gift card to Sam Goody, and he'd gotten it for me because I'd mentioned a few weeks before there was an CD coming out that I really wanted. I was overjoyed. Next time I saw him I gushed over the gift and he just smiled uncomfortably and said, ""Awesome!"" then high fived me. So yeah, Tom was cool."
4.0,How did you purpose to your significant other?[SEP]Tea party with homemade desserts in an arboretum. Had a friend get her dressed up to go to an event that got 'canceled'. Hired guitarist to play our song when she arrived and hang out and play after I proposed. We had our tea and some snacks and 20min later our friends and family arrived to celebrate.
4.0,"Should a student who's living alone and is tight on money get a cat or a dog?[SEP]no, animals cost between $1500-$2000 a year for basic things, more if they ahve issues. I saw peopel have to put down animals when they could not pay for care. Housing is also a lot more with a pet. We had to pay $350 more for a smaller apartment to find a place that would take our dog. Do not consider a pet unless financially secure. Too many have to put them down when they can't afford care or can't afford a new apartment to take them. very cruel."
4.0,What's the craziest thing you've done while drunk?[SEP]Ate a quarter ounce of mushrooms while blacked out. I didn't find out I had done them until my buddy told me about it haha.

5.0,"What is the dumbest thing you believed as a kid?[SEP]Airplane fuel is rainbow colored. I think I got it from looking at gas station colours for each type of fuel. My reasoning was that because an airplane was so big, it would need some sort of 'super gas' to be able to fly"

4.0,What’s the longest you have been without food and how did you feel?[SEP]Without calories or without food? Longest I've ever gone zero calories was about 4 days. I was tired and cranky and stressed. I've gone weeks without eating solid food though because meal replacement powder and stealing milk from work is way cheaper than groceries.
5.0,"ELI5: Why do all stringed musical instruments produce the same notes in the same picking spots?[SEP]The overtone series, or harmonics series. Assuming you are referring to the fret location rather than relative pitch between the different strings: Our 12 note Western standard music system is based (approximately) on the overtone series. An open string, let's say E, will vibrate at a wavelength relative to its length. A string (of the same tension) of half the length, or fretted halfway along the length, will produce an E, but up one octave, and it's wavelength will also be half. Now, let's say instead you want to divide that string in 3 (or put a fret along a third of its length): you will produce B in the octave above. Dividing by 4 will be E again (half of a half). Dividing by 5 will produce G#, the major 3rd of the key of E, the reason why a major triad sounds so naturally pleasant to our ears: everything resonates with these relative frequencies within them. The next prime number division, dividing by 7, is the flat 7th of the key. Then a ninth (third of a third) will be an F#, albeit a rather sharp one. Further subdivisions get a bit further away from our Western harmony, for the following reason, which is why I mentioned earlier that this is approximately; Musical instruments based on pure harmony, and exactly following the principles of physics described above, can only play music written in one key. A key a 4th or 5th away is harmonically similar and you may get away with it, but further around the circle of 5ths (circle of 5ths is further reading for our 5 year old, for now take my word for it) will be further removed from the intended relative pitch, and more dissonant to our ears. Some time around the Baroque era (or earlier) someone realised the pitches are pretty close to where they would be if you divided an octave into 12 equal parts, which birthed our 12 pitched ""equal tempered"" music system. Our Baroque friend JS Bach published ""The Well Tempered Clavier"" containing music in all 12 keys, proving that at that time an instrument had been tuned to be able to be played aesthetically in all 12 keys, though doesn't disprove that it may have been done earlier. The equation to get an instrument equal tempered has something to do with the 12th root of 2, but I don't recall how, or have the math skill to understand even if I remembered. Perhaps someone can elaborate so we can have the best educated 5 year olds on the matter."
4.0,"People whose family kicked you out, where did you go/what did you do?[SEP]I would go to Denny's every night around 2am, sit in the back corner of the smoking section and order coffee and some sort of appetizer. The night manager knew me and wouldn't bother me as long as I paid for the stuff I ordered, so she let me sleep on the booth seat. I would wake up between 6 and 7, pay my bill plus tip and drive back to my parents house. They didn't bother to change the alarm code or where they hid the spare key, and by that time they were at work, so I would let myself in, take a shower, do laundry, eat breakfast, whatever needed doing until I had to be at work. On the weekends I would crash at my friends place, but he worked a 9 to 5, I was in retail, so he couldn't deal with my schedule during the week. This lasted for a few weeks until I was able to convince another friend that the two of us and a few other friends should all go in together and rent a house."

4.0,"What is your most hilarious karen incident you where ever a part of?[SEP]Lady got mad at me for not knowing if a specific collar would fit her dog. She said the dog was a mastiff/border collie mix and she didn’t measure its neck and couldn’t even estimate the size with her hands. She told me if I said “I don’t know” one more time she would speak to my manager. My manager told her to come back with her dog and just try it on. And she was rude as hell, like why the fuck would I help you if you’re already being rude ughhh"
5.0,"People who are on No Fly List, what's your story?[SEP]My dad has almost the same name (dad is a Junior) and exact same birthday as a fairly well known domestic terrorist. Dad is technically not on the no fly list but because of the similarity he is pulled every time he flies. Yes, it is easily explained but they still still check all of the boxes on their list, questioning him, questioning anyone he is flying with, searching luggage (checked and carry on), verifying everything at destination, then starting over and seeing if the story is the same the second and third time you tell it. His job used to include international travel but it got so inconvenient they stopped sending him places."

4.0,"What was your most unexplainable and bizarre experience?[SEP]Doing my homework at the desk when I was like 12 and randomly booking it down the hallway in fear, hiding underneath the kitchen table. My dad was right behind me looking the other way watching TV and never picked up on it. He ended up calling out for me to start heading to bed and that’s when I became self-aware again. It had been ***2 hours***."
4.0,"What can be done with the problem of uncertainty?[SEP]&gt; I wonder why university philosophy professors are still reiterating the words of philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, only to name a few. It is not surprising because their words weren't truthful or profound, it is surprising because of the exponential advancements of human knowledge and technology since their words were spoken. This isn't really true. Most papers, articles and books are going to overwhelmingly references papers, articles and books written in the past 40 years. You can verify this by looking at any article on the SEP, for instance the free will articles cites around 170 articles published in the 21st century, 120 articles published in the 20th century, 3 published in the 18th century and 0 published in the 19th century. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/#Bib &gt;I guess my question, is how can we rightfully make any decisions, without any measurable standard of what is wrong and what is right? It would be hard I imagine, possibly impossible, but I don't think many or any Philosophers think we have no 'measurable standard of what is wrong and what is right'."
5.0,"ELI5:Why can't we move our eyes smoothly(without stopping in between) from side to side or up and down?[SEP]So you can see. When you move your eyes you actually go ""blind"" and only see once the eyes stop. So your eye moves in quick, short movements. The reason it does this is because if you could just move your eyes around it'd be blurry due to the movement. Now, when you're tracking something in your vision your eyes move smoothly because it only matters that what you're tracking is clear."
3.0,"Which conspiracy theory are you absolute certain is true?[SEP]If there's nothing shady about the JFK assassination, why do they keep putting back the date when the files can be fully released?"
4.0,"What are the effects of gender/sex imbalances in societies?[SEP]I believe you are preemptively linking gender in population numbers with the effects of gender in societies. Those are different things, as one would need to prove causation (or at the very least a correlation among population numbers categorized by their gender and in relation to socioeconomics) to make such claims. I can offer no references into this reasoning. Instead, you might want to look into different societies and how they organize themselves in relation to gender and gender roles expectations. A specific study which comes to mind is the differences between Mundugumor, Arapesh and Tchambuli societies by Margaret Mead ([link](https://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/Temperament.pdf)). Other redditors might be able to offer better references which include socioeconomical aspects and gender relations, but I would take those with a grain of salt, as they will most probably be correlational relations, not causation."
4.0,"Outdoor people what's the most disturbing things happened to you in the woods?[SEP]Probably not the type of disturbing you're looking for, but still disturbed me. My (now ex) wife and I were camping in the Uinta mountains, we'd hiked a few hours in and were camped right off the trail because we'd gotten a late start and setup pretty much in the dark. So we're sitting around camp the next afternoon when this family comes walking by on the trail, a dad and mom and their daughter (probably 10). The little girl says to her parents ""We should ask them."" So the parents stop and ask if we've seen their son. And we've only seen one other person on the trail in hours, a man in his 30s. So we're like, ""Don't think so, how old is he?"" ""He's 6."" No, we definitely have not seen a six year old just wandering on the trail. So we tell them, and they are just completely unphased. ""It's fine, he's probably just up ahead."" We stress again that the only person we've seen in hours is 30 year old man. ""No it's fine."" And they keep walking. So we're obviously kinda freaked out, and about 15-20 minutes later we hear what sounds like a kid yelling from deep in the woods, way away from the trail in basically the opposite direction they went. So I grab a walky-talky and head off towards the sound while my wife stayed in camp. So way back in the trees, nowhere near a trail, I find a little boy just *wailing* for his mom. He's got a backpack, but it's unzipped and the only thing in it is a light sleeping bag that's about to fall out, and he's only go a light jacket. So I tell him I've seen his parents and convince him to come with me. I'm radioing back to my wife that I've found him, and she tells me she's got the family there. But that they didn't believe we'd found him and are about to keep going. Fortunately, they hear his voice through the radio and wait. So I get him back to camp, and his parents just tell him to get moving, don't acknowledge how freaked out he is or thank us. Only his sister has the decency to say thanks and seems happy to actually have him back. My wife was fuming and said after they left we should have taken him to the ranger station instead of giving him back to his parents. Which I kind of agree with. And I just hope the kid appreciates how lucky he is that the big bearded guy that found him in the woods actually had seen his parents and actually was trying to help."
5.0,"What happened on the worst plane ride you've ever been on?[SEP]The day after I got married, my wife and I were leaving for our Honeymoon. We had to get to the airport at 3 in the morning to board our flight on time that left at 5. When we arrived at the airport, we found out there was a problem with our seats, and we were going to sit 7 rows apart from one another, on opposite sides of the plane. Even though the flight was only an hour and a half long to our connecting flight, I was so angry I wanted to fight someone. Upon arriving to our connecting flight location, we found out our seating arrangements were going to be the same. We would have to sit many rows apart for a 7 hour flight. I asked the people who worked for the flight line if they could get us seats together, and they gave us seats that were in the same row, separated by the aisle. It was the fire exit row, so we had extra leg room, and we were able to see each other and still occasionally talk for the 7 hour flight."
4.0,"What are some small, unnoticed ways we as a society have made social progress in the last two decades?[SEP]I feel like it is much more acceptable to be nostalgic about childhood interests these days than it was in the past. I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for, but feeling nostalgic is a great feeling, and it's nice to know that it's more acceptable these days! Almost like, it would be totally awesome these days if someone wore a Tommy Pickles hoodie as an adult, but 20 years ago I feel like that would have been considered lame."
4.0,"Before technology, how did teens with a lot of time on their hands spend their time?[SEP]Getting into trouble / trying to get laid"
3.0,"If someone makes you feel belittled by talking about their accomplishments that are drastically more impressive than yours and still ask “Wby” even though you already told them...what is a way to react verbally/tone/body language without showing the sudden insecurity you may feel?[SEP]If someone was trying to one-up me every time and then still ask me questions about things I already explained them before, why would that make *me* insecure? It seems to me that the other one is the insecure type. You could react with ""Ok, let me try to explain it again. Slower ... "" but that's not going to help other than make you feel better for a few minutes."
3.0,What is a good thing that has happened to you today?[SEP]Got my car back from the shop after someone backed into it while parked
5.0,"I am 20 years old and people say I care too much to the degree its toxic ?[SEP]It’s not about offering help. When you avoid bothering people at all cost at all times you come across as having no backbone and personality. Continue to be respectful, but whenever something comes up that you don’t agree with speak up. When someone asks for your opinion be honest and disregard whether others are upset. Being harmless out of fear is not a virtue. I imagine it is hard to find balance between cordiality and being unfiltered if you have the habit of being too nice, so here is a simple formula: try to phrase the truth in a respectful way (not harmless, someone will inevitably be upset). If you’re saying something for the sheer purpose of pleasing someone, don’t say it. If you’re not stating your own opinion completely honestly then either say nothing at all or be authentic. Yes, do care for others but also for yourself. Respect yourself by standing up for your values. I know it can be tough, I personally am naturally avoidant of confrontation. But it’s an important skill to have, and I suggest you think hard about how you can fix your insecurities and become a more confident person."
4.0,"What is the worst mistake anyone can make as a teenager?[SEP]Taking on debt of any fashion, unless you have the financial means or plan to back it up"
5.0,"When is the best time to reveal your villains motivation?[SEP]It depends on how important the villain’s motivation is to the plot, and how soon you want the reader to know. Sometimes, the motivation is obvious from the beginning. Sometimes it seems obvious, but then the actual motivation is revealed midway through, or even at the end. And of course sometimes it is a complete mystery until the middle or end. What I often find with this one though, is that if the motivation is not at all clear by that point, it’s often because we (the audience) don’t know who the villain is yet, or the villain is more of a shadowy character about whom very little is known. Once the villain is found, their motivation usually becomes known soon afterwards, or in the case of mysteries, we start to learn about the motivation first, then connect that to a suspect to get a full picture. Certainly, having the villain’s motivation gradually revealed over time works too, but it’s not the only good approach. It’s really up to you :)"
4.0,What are some old memes that you do NOT miss?[SEP]replacing all vowels with “er” Erh meh gerd!
5.0,"What was that one time you thought you really messed things up but everything went fine or for the better?[SEP]One time when I was a teenager I was borrowing my mom's car, the guy I was dating at that point was driving tho. He went to change lanes and while he was looking behind him, he merged simultaneously with a truck who was coming in from the other direction. I yelled for him to stop but it was too late, the truck's trailer hitch stabbed into the grille of the car. When the guy pulled his truck forward to get the hitch out, it ripped most of the grille off with it. Luckily the radiator was fine but the car looked hideous. We only had an hour or so to beeline it to a pull your own part junk yard place, we planned on grabbing a replacement and fixing it at a gas station before bringing it back to my house. But they didn't have any identical cars so we had to tell my mom about it. I expected her to be furious, but she really didn't care and said she was planning on getting a new car anyway."
2.0,The first member of Gen Z becomes a late night talkshow host. How will the first episode go down?[SEP]i dont think gen z watches late night talkshows. the only late night show i watch is saturday night live
4.0,"Aside from the most painful, what was the most pleasurable physical experience you ever had?[SEP]Few years ago I had poison ivy on 80% of my body and taking a hot shower felt *so* good that sometimes I daydream about getting poison ivy again just to feel that feeling again"
4.0,"People from all over the world, what's considered racist in your country that is not racist somewhere else?[SEP]Paki is incredibly offensive in the UK, but is apparently acceptable in the USA."
4.0,"How Did You Be Successful With A ""Useless Degree""?[SEP]When I realised after my graphic design degree that all entry level jobs were minimum wage and i still had to compete with hundreds of people for each position. I went to an interview once at a company for a min wage job and received a brief in a hall with 500 other people. I went to uni, had a full portfolio, and I still had to do assignments. I became an accountant. Anyone can be an accountant, everything you need to know is online/readily available. You just need to know the basics of math and how to problem solve. The degree helped get an entry level position. And that position a better position, and again and again."
4.0,"What advice would you have for someone who is in love?[SEP]For all the comments criticizing OP for being in love, why? let OP be happy. As for you OP, don't give up on what you have. If you guys get into an argument just think about it and learn to change because both of you need to give a little to work things out. Now I'm not saying to apologize for everything and vice versa, but to learn to change stuff. If you're a junior/senior in highschool, then capitalise on it because it's a great place to meet someone, but don't get too serious too quick. If you're above legal age then just don't go to quick, go with the flow and how fast your SO wants to go, but remember to know your boundaries too, if you're uncomfortable, say something. If you find a keeper now; don't let go, if you let go, you'll lose the one who cared for you the most and the more you get older the less keepers there will be. But just remember: go with the flow; know yours, and your SOs, boundaries; and consent is key."
3.0,"Why is it so exceedingly difficult for us to think beyond capitalism? How have we come to embrace what one author has called “capitalist realism”? Why is it easier for us to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism, to quote Žižek, or whoever it is that said it?[SEP]&gt; Why is it so exceedingly difficult for us to think beyond capitalism? Follow-up question. How do we answer this question with a clear demarcation between capitalism and presentism? For example, say we ask this question in the possible world where the United States in 2021 uses Feudalism: ""Why is it so exceedingly difficult for us to think beyond Feudalism?"" Presumably some of the answers will be the same. This because those answers are really about the bias of presentism, rather than actual qualities of capitalism, feudalism, or whatever economic system that possible world happens to use. Assuming that is true, then there would seem to be a functional difference between: * Why is it so exceedingly difficult for us to think beyond capitalism? * Why is it so exceedingly difficult for us to think beyond the way economics current works? When answering OP's question, here, how do we distinguish difficulties of thinking beyond capitalism, and difficulties of thinking beyond the current economic system? What difficulties result from capitalism, and what difficulties result from the normal human bias of ""This is just how things work.""?"
4.0,"What advice would you give to someone moving from England to the American South?[SEP]You'll be fine. Just be humble, accept that there are differences between the countries and don't complain about them too much, and be polite. The vast majority of us Americans are exceedingly nice and welcoming, regardless of what part of the country you are going. While it is odd to say this (since in theory elected leaders are supposed to be representative of who they govern), our elected officials (or famous celebrities) that frequently make the news are typically not representative of who we are."
4.0,"Was there any time when you thought that your military spouse was involved in secret mission or project?[SEP]My nephew had some sort of security clearance, and was an avid long distance runner. He would train by running up and down mountain trails. He would leave for 3, 4 days of training then reappear. We all agreed he was on a mission, his wife laughed at us but he sure could run"
5.0,"What is a secret you found out about someone after they died?[SEP]After my grandfather died my mom was helping her brother go threw their dad's stuff. And they found out that my grandfather had been regularly tipping quite a bit to a waitress in need, at the local coffee shop he would go to regularly. And over the course of 15 years of going there she got over 50k in tips from my grandfather alone. We wondered why she was getting such large tips because my grandfather never tipped that much at any other place. And when we asked her about why she was getting 20-40$ tips from my grandfather. She was actually very genuine and upfront and told us that she was a single mother and when my grandfather would come around she would sometimes have the kid at the coffee shop because she couldn't find a babysitter. And my grandfather being a nice guy would always buy a meal for the kid on his dime, and then tip 20-40$ for the waitress saying ""I know every bit helps."" To this day it warms my heart to know just how amazingly generous and kind hearted my grandfather was."

4.0,"What basic skill did you never learn and why?[SEP]I didnt learn to wash properly until I was 13. I would wash my hair but nothing else, just rinse off for a long time. I think I never learned due to neglectful parents (I eventually went into foster care) and ""autism"" (i put it in quotes because i seemed to grow out of my autism which makes me wonder if i even had it or i was just that way because i was neglected and hadn't picked up of normal behavior due to lack of interaction)."
3.0,What are your favourite bad movies?[SEP]The Room by Tommy Wiseau
3.0,What are some disadvantages to being right-handed that is right-handers don’t realize?[SEP]To be retought. I was born left handed but my lovely mommy tought me right handed I still don't understand why! This is crazy!😕

4.0,What's something you wish never heard ?[SEP]You can break your thumb or a tendon or something on your thumb if you hold it inside your fist and then quickly do a whipping motion with your wrist. I struggle to explain the whole action but knowing this is like an infohazard. Cognitive dissonance really pushing me to do it
4.0,What’s a song that always makes you feel happy?[SEP]Hard rock hallelujah - lordi

5.0,"ELI5: On a deeper level than “oil repels water so the water with detergent can’t get in to break up the stain,” why are grease stains so hard to get out of clothes?[SEP]Water is ""polar"", which means that one side of the molecule has a positive charge and the other side has a negative charge - like a north pole and a south pole. This makes water a great solvent for polar materials, since it can ""grab"" them very easily (like a magnet grabbing iron dust). Grease is ""non-polar"" - basically they're neutral, instead of positive and negative. Water can't really grab it - it would be like trying to use a magnet to pick up plastic. The simple rule for this is ""like dissolves like"": materials will dissolve other materials which are like them. That means that polar materials are crappy at dissolving non-polar materials."
5.0,"ELI5: What is physically different between a high-end CPU (e.g. Intel i7) and a low-end one (Intel i3)? What makes the low-end one cheaper?[SEP]Imagine a fancy bakery. Their main customers expect nothing but the best cakes possible, and they make them. Every so often, they'll mess up the frosting, and the entire cake isn't worth the price. So instead of throwing the cake away, they'll repackage it and sell it cheaper instead. Non ELI5: A CPU is just a lot of silicone transistors. And i mean a LOT. Billions even. Imagine a sausage made of silicone, about as wide as your palm, which then gets sliced into thin discs called wafers. There's multiple chips on one wafer. Silicone isn't perfect, and often, there'll be a crack or imperfection right on top of a chip. So instead of throwing the whole wafer away, they'll use what they have, and sell it cheaper. Silicone is ridiculously expensive, so they have to use every little bit they can. EDIT: It's silicon, not silicone, I'm baffled by how I messed it up"
2.0,"You are now immortal. How do you find out and what do you do knowing?[SEP]Knowing how suicidal I'm, it won't take long for me to find out."
4.0,"Folks Aged 20-40 - What kind of hip new developments do you expect you'll be an old curmudgeon about, someday?[SEP]At a certain point, I'm going to refuse to learn any more tech. The speed of tech development in my lifetime is unparalleled throughout the whole of human history. With the possible exceptions of electricity and the internal combustion engine, I don't think the world has ever witnessed such fast-paced development and adaptation of technology with such massive consequences for both our working lives and day-to-day living: last night I summoned food to my doorstep with the same rectangle I'm holding in my hand to type this comment. For my generation and younger ones, this rapid change is normal. Think about the fact that it's normal for us to watch a piece of technology become obsolete half-a-decade after its invention. I have never owned anything on Blu-ray. I went from VHS to DVD to pirating to streaming. I skipped an entire invention and barely noticed. But all this change is becoming exhausting. I don't want to ever have to learn a new OS. I hate that so much software requires its own app or account (for data mining.) I'm having to constantly Google 'How to...' to trouble-shoot a device or learn my way around an app that's suddenly become essential for online teaching. And then the app gets an update and all the settings are in the wrong place and its background is now yellow. In a decade or two I'm going to be the lady with the wispy grey hair in the phone shop refusing to upgrade my nanobot implants to enable the holograph display and insisting that they sell me an obsolete device only found in museums and shoe boxes because *the old smart phones worked better.*"
4.0,What was the most unintentionally creepy thing you've ever said/done? Ideas?[SEP]I came out of the train at night and saw my 6'1'' blonde flatmate ahead of me on the stairs. I shouted HEY WAIT UP. I tried to catch up but she didn't hear me and she's crazy fast walker. It started raining so I started running so she would let me share her umbrella. I tried closing the gap between us but got closer once we got to the door finally. Except it was the door next to mine. She slammed it and locked it. It wasn't my flatmate. Whoops.
5.0,"ELI5: How is HTTPS any more secure than HTTP, if literally anyone can implement it?[SEP]All that a TLS certificate is, is a signed witness statement by some group (an ""authority"") that says, ""This guy is who he says he is, I checked. Signed, XYZ Authority"". You only get certificates if you can somehow prove to one of these authorities that you are who you say you are, and that you own the web domain that you say you do. Convince them of this, and they'll sign you a certificate. Practically all consumer computers come pre-installed with a list of groups that the computer will trust right out of the box. If your computer goes to a website and that website provides a certificate signed by someone on that list, your computer will trust it. If you click on the padlock in the address bar, that will show you the website's certificate. If you inspect the certificate, you might see a ""Verified By"" section--that's the authority that issued the website its certificate, and presumably, it will be one your computer is trained to trust. Thus, the point of a certificate isn't specifically how hard or easy they are to get. It's all about *who* you get certificates *from*. I could easily run some software and generate you some perfectly secure certificates, just as good as any other certificate out there. But it won't be worth anything because that certificate will be signed by me, some random nobody that isn't on anyone's trust lists. You could even have your server create and sign its own certificate (a so-called ""self-signed"" certificate) if you want to, but again, no one would trust it. If you want a certificate that you can just throw out onto the Internet and have almost everyone trust it right away, you're going to need to get a certificate from one of the big boys. You can find this list on your PC and edit the list to add or subtract whatever authorities you want. Some private networks like ones you might find in offices or school campuses often do this when they launch internal websites. They'll create their own certificate authority, then instruct all the computers on the network to add the network's new authority to their list of trusted authorities. That way, the network can create whatever web domains they want and secure them with TLS."
3.0,"How to deal with loud SO playing video games??[SEP]Jees, he's a *guest* for crying out loud. I'd tell him if he can't behave himself like a proper houseguest, he's going to have to leave, because he's being unkind to your mother, *whose house it is*. If he gets bent out of shape over that, consider whether you actually want to be involved with such an asshole."
4.0,"What skills do you wish you’d developed ahead of your social science postgrad studies?[SEP]I’d recommend strengthening your project management skills. You’ll need to be able to manage several research projects all at various stages and it can be difficult to stay organized and on track. You’ll probably have more time on your hands that you are used to, and lots of work with unclear deadlines, so time management also is important. As is figuring out how you work best, because grad school gives you the flexibility to do your work however, whenever, and sometimes, wherever, you want."
4.0,What are the best horror movies to date ?[SEP]Exorcist fucked me up when I was a kid.

3.0,What’s one thing you think you could do to be a better parent? What’s stopping you?[SEP]Well I could probably start by actually having a child.
4.0,"[Magic, In general] How do muggles who are apart religions that believe in Magic react to the Mages who actually have superpowers?[SEP]Based on the people I knew in high school who pretended to have real supernatural abilities for attention, I imagine they'd be super pissed at being upstaged. They'd probably try to cast a curse that wouldn't work, try to spread a mean rumor that would also fizzle, then fake a medical condition for sympathy; some cross between fibromyalgia and their best impression of a grand mal seizure."
5.0,"eli5 To what extent are brains like computers?[SEP]Computers generate heat because they work by way of electrons flowing through metal constantly. Since there is always some resistance, you get heat. Neurons don't work anything like that. They transmit information by way of electrochemical potentials where a polarized membrane depolarizes and a wave of depolarization travels down an axon and at the synapse, little molecules physically eject from one terminal and bond with the other. None of this generates significant heat. Cooling is also not a problem because the brain's power comes from massive parallel processing with enormous numbers of connections between units instead of computers which still largely rely fewer processing units that can process many millions of times a second. You can probably never do a thing like play a video game on a brain simply because it does not have the sort of features you'd need for that... plus the neurons are busy doing things like keeping you alive. How are they alike? Both brains and computers are kinds of information processors. This is a big deal because not so long ago, nobody really had the first clue how a kilo of grey goo could do things like reason or think. The advent of machines answered this question for us. Once you have a machine that can take some sort of input, modify it according to a rule, and spit out the result... you can (theoretically) put together some number of these that can do any kind of calculation or any kind of thinking. Thinking is information processing. This is also why many believe you could replicate every important feature of a human brain in some other form, silicon or some future hardware device... because info processing is info processing. The ""software"" of our minds or any imaginable mind, could run on any hardware with sufficient performance characteristics."
4.0,"How do you attract friends? What aspect of a stranger you meet would want you to be their friend?[SEP]I’m kind and good at conversing with anyone. I’m approachable. I’m also not the most unattractive person in the world, which would probably help."
4.0,What's the worst concert you've been to?[SEP]Ozzy Osbourne i saw him maybe two years ago. They had all the instruments turn up that you could barely hear him because he couldn't get most of the lyrics right. I felt bad becuase he was a great musician. But he really isnt any much good shape for doing love shows..... at least he had looked like he was having fun. But i really think he needs to retire for good
4.0,"ELI5: If you go to bed hungry, why do you wake up not as hungry?[SEP]You know how we eat to provide fuel for our bodies? Well the process of food getting turned into fuel and used by our bodies is called our ""metabolism."" When you are sleeping, because you're not eating, that process slows down, like how a fire goes out when you stop adding wood to it. (But it's not like when you're awake and don't eat for a long time and feel really hungry, because you're unconscious, so you don't ""feel"" the hunger while your metabolism is slowing way down.) When you first wake up, your metabolism hasn't jumped back into action yet, and so your body doesn't tell you to eat right away. Funnily enough, EATING is what will kick your metabolism back into gear. Also, little messengers called ""hormones"" get sent around your body when it's time to wake up so that you will have enough energy to get up, but they also cause the amount of sugar in your blood to go up. That can make you feel a little bit queasy too. Also also, your stomach can make acid when it thinks you're going to eat soon, but if there's nothing in there for it to work on, it can make you feel queasy too.

3.0,What are things that still function perfectly fine when they’re broken?[SEP]Some examples: Broken escalator is just stairs. Broken electric toothbrush is just a regular manual toothbrush.
5.0,"Thinking about meeting people, what would you prefer: organizing events/gatherings, joining other events/gatherings or staying at home?[SEP]As a fellow introvert, I say all three options work really well, but this is how I would approach each option: A - mostly works with friends who have a common bond (school, work, interest, etc). Trying to get a random group together may or may not work if there’s nothing that they have in common. B - this works well if you can keep your expectations of meeting people low. Instead of focusing on trying to build a core group right away, focus on one small task for socializing throughout the night like: talking to one person you’ve been meaning to talk to, ask for contact info for one person to keep things going, or join a smaller group (like 2-4 people) for conversation. C - nowadays it’s pretty hard to develop a bond with someone purely out of circumstance. If you’re able to start small talk with someone out of nowhere this could work, but since people nowadays tend to keep to themselves when going out (and also with the pandemic enforcing social distancing and mask mandates in businesses) it’s almost impossible for others to want to make small talk to you. In regards to doing things alone: you can always try to ask existing friends/acquaintances if they’d be interested in joining you for doing certain things. You gain companionship if they join and if they don’t you still get to do what you were planning to do anyways. Best of luck OP!"
4.0,"Is it normal to have a bit of a subconscious manipulative streak to you?[SEP]You have basically just described the average human experiance. We all have bouts of this manipulative-esque streak in us. Sometimes its actually nessaccary to be successful, ive alsi heard this trait be called ""social engineering"".....really though, you seem to have aknowledged this at a level which will end up benefiting you. You may have a manipulative streal in you but you also seemingly have a decent amount of self awareness I have these exact same tendencies (here i am giving out advice in a similar fashion you described in yourself) but they can be used in a more positive and effective manner. I highly doubt your a sociopath or anything of the such. I to looked back on a recently ended long-term relationship with alot of quilt in the ways i manipulated to get my way and how much this changed my ex to this day. To make it simple, stay self aware. Know that this is an asset that can be cultivated into a positive skill of sorts. Recognizing is half the battle..."
3.0,What is the most interesting debate you have heard?[SEP]If there is objective morality
5.0,"Today we studied that there is no oxygen on the sun. Then how does it burn?[SEP]It’s not chemical combustion. It is nuclear fusion. “In nuclear fusion, the nuclei of atoms are fused together to make new, bigger nuclei. Since the nucleus of an atom determines what the atom is and how it behaves, a change to the nucleus causes the atom to become a new element. For instance, two hydrogen atoms fuse together to make one helium atom. Nuclear fusion does not require oxygen. In fact, you don't need any other material at all. You just need enough pressure or heat to squeeze the nuclei of the atoms close enough that they overcome their electrostatic repulsion and bond into a single nucleus.” -[source](https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/mobile/2015/03/20/why-does-the-sun-not-run-out-of-oxygen-as-it-burns/)"
4.0,"How do you create an intro that's mostly just a summary of your setting and tone, without losing readers' interest?[SEP]The answer to your question is both simple and complex: dynamism. First of all, prologues are difficult to pull off because more often than not, they just contain information that should be salted into the story elsewhere. You've got to have a majorly compelling reason to begin a story before the beginning, and nine times out of ten, when you think you have one, you're wrong. Of course, as with most writing advice, none of that matters if you've got the fucking juice to pull it off. If you write exposition as well as John Cheever, and it's fucking scintillating to your readers, then prologue away--but part of learning to write is learning how to accurately and honestly assess your strengths and weaknesses. If you were looking to buy a book for $25 to $30, would you be willing to pay that sum to read what you've written?"
4.0,"what career choice will you never go for under any circumstance?[SEP]Port-o-potty cleaner, especially in the city, a lot of homeless people like to make their home in them, once saw one where the guy set a fire in the urinal part to keep warm in the winter"
4.0,"What’s the advantages of being a tall person?[SEP]I was born for this. At 6'7"" the benefits can be tremendous, but there are drawbacks. Pros: •I can see the stage clearly at EVERY concert. •Easy to spot in a crowd. •I can hide my snacks in the back of the top cabinets and no one I know will see them. •My fiancé accidentally shaved a chunk out of my hair one year and no-one saw it. (Top/back of my head) •I make some nice shade for smaller folks. •I reach things in stores for people who ask. That feels nice. •People seem to be amazed at tall people these days. Cons: •Size 16 shoes aren't easy to find. •Ceiling fans in shorter houses. •Staircase doors. •Parking lot signs. •Sometimes I scare children in stores. •I was considered dangerously large for Pee-wee football. (Always been very tall.) •People behind me at concerts are screwed. •I've stepped on very short people without seeing them before. Feels bad. •""How's the weather up there?"""
4.0,People whose parents are 50+ y.o : How do you handle their mood swings and tantrums?[SEP]Elderly parent tantrum survivor here. For context although i love him profusely my old father will begin to scream and throw shit when he loses something or is irritated. Has done it since sixty no dementia present. to answer your question Ive tried comforting. Mostly I shut it down. like i don’t allow it to continue and i say stop this is ridiculous you can’t throw a tantrum and this is an abuse of my emotions. and that he needs to deal with his emotions and problems like everyone else . that honestly has worked. I’m not cruel when i say it but firm and understanding and i validate his emotions but not behavior. Then i help the situation like help him find the thing he lost. Beware this is a bit of an escalation and may agitate. I’m experimenting with different methods. In the future i’m going to try ignoring it and staring at him until he realizes what he’s doing bc honestly interfering and calming him down is a huge emotional toll on me. It’s less stress on me
4.0,"How does one start investing ?[SEP]Think about companies or ideologies that interest you. Example: you're familiar with the tech world, you can aquire securities (stocks) in certain companies you believe will do well. If you're into supporting the environment, looking into green companies. After you have an idea of what you want to invest in, look into different brokers. Some offer little to no cost for trades, but you have to investigate what their drawbacks are for the price and ability. Always keep in mind past value of a security will not dictate future value. Just because a company has always done well doesn't mean it's guaranteed (granted more likely.)"
4.0,"What advice would you give someone who is starting a philosophy degree in a few months?[SEP]When I was in college I started off in accounting, switched to philosophy, went to an analytical program (CUNY Graduate Center), and then did another switch over to continental at Vandy for my terminal degree. So my advice for this summer is to read a variety of books representing different traditions and periods: ancient, medieval, modern, analytical, continental, pragmatism, Eastern as well as looking into different branches from aesthetics and feminism to the philosophy of mind. If that's too much to put on your plate, simply select a reasonable variety and read as voraciously as possible. If you're going into analytical, you're going to have to read Kripke and Quine at some point, so you may want to start with them. You haven't said what you've read, but Plato is always a good point of entrance broadly speaking. And if you develop any curiosity about continental, I recommend Nietzsche and Camus as highly provocative and entertaining material. Save Hegel and Heidegger for later, haha!"
5.0,"ELI5: How are microchips programmed to know what is a 1 and 0? Is it created with a hardwired coding language built-in from the very beginning?[SEP]How a processor works I think it's outside of an ELI5. But I'll try to explain the underlying concepts. Remember the basic math operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division? Well, there's a part of maths that deal with another kind of calculations: logic, that uses concepts like ""true"" or ""false"" instead of numbers. George Boole developed a way of calculating things using logic, what is now called Boolean algebra or Boolean logic, defining some basic operations called ""logic gates"" based on logic concepts, usually using 1 and 0 to represent true and false respectively. Let's use the idea of a conjunction: given two premises, both have to be true for the conclution to be true. For instance, if you want to hire someone to do maintenance work in a lot of places, you would ask for someone with the expertise *and* to have a driver's licence, you don't want someone with only one of those traits. In Boolean logic, there's a logic gate called AND that's used in the same vein: it has two inputs, and one output that will only give a 1 if both inputs are a 1, but if not, it will give a 0. Other logic gates, generally transforming two inputs in one output, are OR (the output is 1 if either input is 1), NOT (there's only one imput, and the gate inverts its value), XOR (""exclusive or"", it's the same as the OR but if both inputs are 1, then the output is 0)... If you combine them in certain ways, you can create more complex circuits, such as an adder (a basic calculator that adds binary numbers together). A processor is a combination of those kind of circuits."
4.0,"Those who only wanted a casual fling but ended up in a serious relationship, whats your story ?[SEP]I hooked up with my best friend; we’d been kinda-sorta flirting for a while but when he suggested we hook up I was initially pretty reluctant about it - we were both still kind of hurting from break-ups with our previous partners, I didn’t want to weird up the friendship, and also he was drunk so I worried I’d be taking advantage of him. Then the next time he suggested hooking up, *I* was drunk and didn’t want to do anything silly. Then we were finally both sober, and it was kinda fun so we kept hooking up. Just, you know, for fun. A few months later he had a conversation with his housemate that went something like this: “Is your girlfriend staying over tonight?” “Huh? Oh, no we’re just friends who hook up.” “Uh huh. She’s got her own towel and toothbrush in the bathroom though, right?” “Yes?” “And she’s stayed over like five nights a week every month since I moved in?” “Yes.” “And she went out to dinner with you and your mum when she was in town?” “Yes.” “Mate, that’s your girlfriend. She staying over or what?” Anyway we’re still together four years later and it’s the best relationship either of us have ever had, so that’s pretty cool."
4.0,"What is something you plan on telling future generations when they ask about the pandemic?[SEP]I personally plan on telling them that it was a big time of uncertainty with a little fear. That many people lost their lives and I plan on explaining about the worldwide lockdown and the videos of people in Italy all singing together from their apartment balconies to raise morale. I’ll tell them all about the mass hysteria and panic buying with the toilet paper. I’ll talk about how the pandemic showed me that many, many people care more about personal convenience over the safety of others, and I’ll talk all about the masks we had to wear and the politics at the time surrounding it."
3.0,What fashion style needs to make a comeback?[SEP]80's leotards and other workout clothing. Shiny spandex is hot.
3.0,"When/How did you know you fell out of love with your s/o?[SEP]She told me she was going to go out and find another man to sleep with trying to upset me and I thought ""I hope you do. I need a night without all your bullshit."""
4.0,"Boyfriend's friend/my mutual friend has blocked me and avoided me at work. It makes it difficult to not feel awkward as a result. Have I done something wrong?[SEP]Don't let his actions bother you its probably nothing to do with you but more or less to do with himself... your taking taking it a lil personal in my opinion. Don't own other peoples crap, your good girl! Apparently he Doesn't have the ""huevos"" to tell you the truth on his actions, but nor does he have to honestly. Hes your boyfriends friend. So next time you have to walk past him or interact with him do as what he does to you..."
5.0,"What is something you always wanted to confess, but are scared to?[SEP]I get weird and paranoid about the strangest things. Like I overheard a conversation three years ago where somebody was inviting other people in the room to come with them once this cool place opened up (as usual, I was not invited) and being left out like that made me very anxious. The person who did the inviting I haven’t seen since 2019 and VERY VERY recently the place finally actually opened and I wondered did they ever go through with the plans where everyone there got invited except for me. Like most people would have completely forgot about that conversation, while it has haunted me for this long."
3.0,"Your body becomes transparent, what would you do next?[SEP]I'd take a moment to look at the situation clearly."
5.0,"ELI5: How do people put the little text by their usernames?[SEP]They’re called flairs, and whether you can do so or not depends on the subreddit, for example you can’t add one here. Some also only allow presets, and others you can make your own. I’m on mobile so I can’t say for desktop (think it’s on the sidebar), but there should be 3 little dots in the top right on the actual subreddit page, or you can click on your username and change it that way."
4.0,What’s the weirdest fact about human anatomy?[SEP]The funny bone isn’t actually a bone but a nerve
4.0,"What’s the best comeback you have ever heard?[SEP]If you wanted my come back, you would have to wipe it from your mother’s chin"

3.0,Those who were put under anaesthesia what was it like?[SEP]Your out then your up not much to tell I was under a couple days ago
4.0,"Ambidextrous people, what were the cons you've experienced for being one?[SEP]I went through private education in school and they saw early on that I used both hands. They tried to change that and force me right handed, so in school I wrote right handed and at home I wrote left handed. The only thing that sucks about it is my handwriting is kinda shit. Unsure how true it is but basically I’ve been told that if you’re ambidextrous you lose a bit of control in certain areas (both hands aren’t dominant/ one isn’t dominant because both get used kind of thing which means that you won’t be as good as someone with a dominant hand) again unsure how true it is. The only thing for me is truly my handwriting, I was always told it’s because “boys don’t have good writing skills” but I have plenty of other male friends who write beautifully and I’m over here with chicken scratch. Plus side? My cursive with my left hand? Gorgeous. If I write letters I use a calligraphy pen and will give it some real love, but that’s very few and far between cause ain’t nobody got time for that."
3.0,"What is the worst place to confess love to someone?[SEP]In a quiet library, at a funeral, in an interview...so many"
5.0,"ELI5: How are bridge foundations built?[SEP]You’re not completely wrong in your assumption. But there are many methods to build foundations in water. The image above shows one of those methods, which involves building a temporary cofferdam (the metal ring in the pic above) by driving long, thin, sheet piles through the water and into the soil below until it forms a closed ring. Then, they can pump the water out so the construction crews have room to build formwork for the actual structure in dry conditions. So, what you see above will be removed once the actual structure has been built."
4.0,"What is an insane conspiracy theory that turned out to be true?[SEP]Iran-Contra. Reagan selling missiles to Iran to get funds that congress couldn’t see to fund extreme right narcoterrorists in Nicaragua. The same right wing terrorists who started the crack epidemic in the USA, connecting it to another conspiracy that the CIA facilitated the sale of crack cocaine by the contras as another method of funding this right wing terrorist group. The cia have both admitted and denied their involvement. Everyone involved got a pardon from George Bush senior. Oliver North was one of the ring leaders of this and now he is part of the NRA leadership team. Shit is fucking wild."
2.0,What’s the funniest thing you can tell someone right before they go under anesthesia?[SEP]That you are pregnant with their baby
4.0,"What is a 3D animated movie that you believe would've worked better 2D or vice versa?[SEP]I think we should go back to hand-drawn movies, so pretty much all of them for the past 15 years."
5.0,"What is something that hurt you, but you also kind of like?[SEP]To listen to sad songs on repeat because the part/song that hurts me the most didn’t hurt me enough"
4.0,"Joe Biden put you in charge of minimum wage. What you do? Why?[SEP]Id make it so states set it according to cost of living and it cannot be bare minimum starvation wages. It was implemented to actually support people and that is what it’s intended for. FDR never said “it should be pocket change and people who make it shouldnt be able to support themselves and have to get into enormous debt.” That idea is disgusting. I’m so tired of being seen as less because I don’t have millions in student debt I can’t pay off. I can’t go to college anyway. Also for the love of god: stop screaming about trades. They aren’t for everyone and if everyone DID do trades,they would no longer pay that well or offer good benefits but no one wants to talk about or think about that. They just want to shove the same shitty advice down everybodies throats. There’s such a thing as industries being oversatuated."
4.0,"For anyone that has had Covid, What was your experience like?[SEP]I could not smell anything, and I had difficulties remembering the word ""dog"" when referencing to my dog. Instead, I used ""that hairy thing""."
4.0,When was a time you were happy someone died?[SEP]I was never happy or sad when someone has died yet. Not for my grandma or grandpa. Reason why is Probably because I live in a third world country where I have no one close to me. Which I find kinda good since I don’t have to worry about anyone close to me
3.0,"What is the stupidest super power that anyone could have, and how it might be used?[SEP]Reverse breathing? Like instead of collecting air when breathing in, you do it by breathing out. I don’t know if you can call it a “super power” though"
3.0,"If the colors of your nations flag were flavored, what are the colors and what would those flavors be?[SEP]Like a bomb pop."
5.0,"Why, after the passing of time, do we start to enjoy the pornclips of old times sake (that one clip you haven't seen in ages, but you remember)?[SEP]I think everyone has their ""perfect pornstar"" which has the best qualities he likes or does the stuff he likes. And most of the times this opinion or rather preference do not change overtime or very slightly. So it is rather hard to find something ""better"". But it might as well be nostalgia fap who knows. ;)"
4.0,"What is something traumatic or horrible that you saw/experienced as a child?[SEP]I don’t have any conscious memory of this, but I guess since I did witness it, it still qualifies here. So my parents are big in to rock climbing, and when I was young they’d often take turns watching me while the other climbed. Often the parent watching me would take me on a hike (they had one of those backpacks with a seat in it for a kid) to the top of the climb the other was doing so we could meet them at the top. When I was 2ish, my mom took me on a hike in NH to meet my dad and some friends at the top of a climb. There was a scenic overlook area nearby where lots of visitors took pictures, and near the edge there was a short rope with signs telling people not to go past that point as it was unsafe. There was a family of tourists up there that was speaking a foreign language, and likely could not understand the English signs. My mom and I watched as they stepped over the rope to get a better picture, with one of them staying back to take the shot. While I was watching the scene, smiling and waving as toddlers do, my mom was just thinking how best to communicate to them that they should come back over the rope. Before she could say anything, the woman taking the picture said something and gestured at the group, like she was repositioning someone in the photo. And in an instant, while we watched, one of the teenage daughters took a tiny step back and was gone. She just stepped back and dropped over the edge. My mom said she saw the look on her face for just a second, when she clearly realized what was happening but couldn’t do anything to stop it. Of course the family started screaming and crying. This was before cell phones, and the nearest ranger station was far away. In case she was still alive, they needed to get to her quickly. My dad and his climbing team had to climb over to check her, and when it was very clear that she was gone, they ultimately had to lower her body to the trail below. My mom tried to keep me from seeing any of the gruesome parts of course, but I saw her fall and I saw my dad after, covered in her blood. Apparently I had been relatively calm until I saw that, the site of him like that set me off. Such a terrible thing for that girl and her family...never underestimate the dangers found in nature."
3.0,"What would you do if you figured out your closest friend is coming to harm you?[SEP]I'd rejoice, cause I finally made a friend"
3.0,"If you knew your grave will be dug up far into the future, what is one thing you will take with you when you're buried?[SEP]A multitool. If someone's desperate enough to go about digging up graves, they're probably going to need it."
4.0,IF you could control the wealth of the top 0.01 percent what would you do with it?[SEP]pay other people’s student debt
4.0,"How would 100,000,000 make you happier?[SEP]They say money doesn’t buy happiness, but your not going to see me crying on my new jet ski"
5.0,"People who worked in fast food and retail, what were your Karen encounters if you had any?[SEP]Worked at a sandwich chain - “Karen” was actually my male tech teacher from high school. He just went out of his way to be a pain in the ass. Everything had to be cleaned, gloves changed multiple times, he’d want “fresher food” from out the back. I’m happy to keep customers happy, but he was just a dick about everything. Working in a shoe store - a woman threatened to shut on the floor and throw it at me because I wouldn’t let her kids use the staff toilet, the manager had to explain it’s against store policy because of where the toilet is etc. There was a public toilet in the car park. she was nuts."
4.0,Which is the most salty/angry/butthurt/impossible to please fandom in your opinion?[SEP]I've heard of stories from KPOP fandoms. They just want more and more and more
3.0,"Someone tells you to shake your money maker, what do you shake?[SEP]My car keys. Just getting to work is the challenge."
4.0,If you could own a home anywhere where would it be in the city? A small town? The countryside? Or as far away from other people as possible? And why?[SEP]A penthouse in a high rise skyscraper. Being a bike ride away from things has always been the dream for me. The town I grew up in wasn’t at all designed for pedestrians or cyclists. Everything was far too spread out.
3.0,"What are your thoughts on Artificial meat , that will sold in markets in near future ?[SEP]About time with all the other artificial foods on grocery store shelves. From my perspective though, the innovation is still in its infancy with quite a bit of development before it can compare with natural offerings."
3.0,"your thoughts about Filipino/Filipina when it comes to dating?[SEP]If she's cool, we are into each other, and she's not embarrassed to introduce me to people.... What difference does it make that she's from the Philippines?"
4.0,"Time to ""Work on myself"", what does it mean?[SEP]What they mean by working on themselves is becoming an independent person who does not necessarily need to be in a relationship to be happy. Exercise, pursue interested you may have, take a vacation BY YOURSELF. Go to places for single guys to enjoy. Many single guys need to visit certain places before the get married or fall into some long term relationship: Go to Tijuana and visit the Honk Kong Gentlemen's Club, [https://hktijuana.com](https://hktijuana.com). Go to Montreal, Bangkok, Costa Rica, Amsterdam... these are all cities designed for single men to travel. Learn a new skill, play a musical instrument, take a cooking class or an acting class, get a personal trainer. The point is there is a ton of different things you can do to expand the type of person you are before you wind up tying yourself down into being a couple. Don't lose out on all of these worlds experience simply because you have a habit of sticking yourself in these relationships. You will wind up in your 50's &amp; 60' regretting all that wasted time. Also, avoid these LD relationships for a while. They are not real. You are not in the same room, arguing over where to go to get something to eat or what to do this weekend, or leaving up the toilet seat lid... Those are huge aspects of a relationship you do not experience in a LDR. Once you are in the same room/city then you get the full relationship treatment! That's when things tend to fall apart quickly. You have got to learn to enjoy your own company and seek out new and exciting experiences. That does NOT include falling in love and getting all washed away in another temporary LDR with some poor girl looking for a husband ASAP to fight off her biological clock. &amp;#x200B; I really hope this helped you out. Good luck!"
3.0,"How to go out solo and meet new people?[SEP]Oh man, it really sucks that you haven't seen the golden age of RSD on youtube, they used to show this stuff on video and explain social interactions piece by piece, it's all deleted now sadly. Ask yourself what type of people do you want to meet? Then go to places which have a high volume of these people. When you get there, approach everyone as soon as possible. Have like 20, 10 second interactions and then start going for actual longer conversations later on. You want to put yourself in a talkative mood. How the interactions go also depend on what you do inbetween interactions. Train your mind to see a win in every situation. After every conversation, find 1 thing funny about it, say a 1000 out of 10 and go into the next one. You can still check out RSDTyler (Owen cook), RSDMadison and RSDJulien on youtube"
5.0,"ELI5: why do people’s knees buckle when they receive bad or shocking news?[SEP]The body has something called a vasovagal response, which can be triggered by lots of things including emotional stress, pain, vomiting, or even taking a hard poop. It's basically a glitch in your autonomic nervous system which causes a temporary drop in blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded or pass out. This is the same reason that some people pass out while having blood drawn. The good news is that as long as you don't crack your head on the floor, it's totally benign and goes away on its own."
3.0,How do you know if your local park has sprayed pesticides/herbicides recently?[SEP]You can just call up the park management and ask. Sometimes they will put flags up. If it's an actual nature park then I doubt they would do much spraying and risk harming the wildlife that eat the bugs and plants.
4.0,"Why are 80% of divorces initiated by women?[SEP]I have a beef with your premise. The studies that have been done on this have *really* small sample sizes. The big study that people have relied on with this statistic was only looking at a little over 2,000 people (https://www.asanet.org/press-center/press-releases/women-more-likely-men-initiate-divorces-not-non-marital-breakups / https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2015/08/27/why-women-are-more-likely-to-initiate-divorce/). The other solid study on this puts the number at 63%, but again, only 50 couples were involved (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012696/). I suspect the number isn't nearly as high as these two studies suggest, but if it is, I'd assume it's because men become more likely to cheat on their partner over time, while women are less likely to cheat (https://ifstudies.org/blog/who-cheats-more-the-demographics-of-cheating-in-america / https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21667234/)."
3.0,What is the best comeback you have experienced/known?[SEP]I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as you are.
4.0,What is the most boring video game you've ever played?[SEP]Any looter shooter like Borderlands.
4.0,"People that have predicted the future, what’s your story?[SEP]I predicted Minecraft would be the biggest game of all time when it could barely be called a game. That's my claim to fame. Technically Tetris has sold more units but I think you could argue that Minecraft has had a greater cultural significance overall."
5.0,"What is the best way to hide a body?[SEP]Warm humid climate, warm water - wrap the body in chicken wire and drop it in the water. Expansion with decomposition gasses pushes the body through the chicken wire and makes fish food out of it. Alternatively, very cold water, preferably around the arctic circle. Puncture major cavities, lungs stomach etc then drop the body into the ice cold water. The corpse is practically refrigerated, hence no decomposition hence it won’t float."
5.0,"ELI5 : Why does the area around the wound feels itchy when the wound dries?[SEP]Damaged / inflamed tissue releases histamines, nerve growth factor and other related chemicals. These chemicals help repair tissue damage and magnify the response of nearby pain/heat receptors. When the body releases histamines at/near the sight of the damage, these histamines dilate blood vessels, but ultimately produce the itch sensation."
5.0,"Is it wrong or/and bad to write about the same idea, but in different scenarios and genres?[SEP]Authors have their niche and I think readers follow certain writers because of that. I’m sure in some ways you’re taking a new angle with the themes that you like. You end your post by saying different forms, so if they’re not essentially different stories, at least they’ll feel different. Readers will like what they like and I understand that to some extent you have to care what they think if you hope to publish and sell. Still, you gotta create what you want and like. I tend to fixate on stories about the ruler archetypes. I don’t know why, but something about a person taking on a lot of responsibility and to lead when maybe they’re not prepared to or they don’t want to, intrigues me. You can try and branch off your themes that you fixate on by conjuring side stories that take place in the same worlds you write. Maybe taking that smaller piece will force you to think of a new theme."
3.0,"Retail worker, what are your horror stories?[SEP]Someone pooped in a shopping cart."
